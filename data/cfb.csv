honestcooks11,Recipe,2,"""Ep 1: Vindaloo, an Indo-Portuguese dish from the 16th century is often misrepresented in the present times. Contrary to popular belief, there are NO potatoes in this dish. The confusion may have risen from the phonetic similarity between Vindaloo and ""aloo"" which is the Hindi word for potatoes. In actuality, however, the name ""Vindaloo"" is derived from the Portuguese term: Carne de vinho e alhos. Translated, it means ""meat cooked in wine vinegar and garlic"". 'Vin' plus 'alhos' became Vindaloo.


Now let's get to the recipe. Here is what you'll need:

##INGREDIENTS:   
 
**For Marinating:**
1.	Chicken thighs cut into smaller pcs - 1 lb OR Pork Shoulder or butt if you are going for pork. 
2.	Dried red chilies, to dry roast - 6 pcs OR 5 gm
3.	Cumin, to dry roast - 3/4 tbsp OR 6gm
4.	Cloves, to dry roast - 1 tsp OR 9-10 pcs
5.	Black peppercorn, to dry roast - 1 tsp OR 3gm
6.	Black Mustard, to dry roast - 3 gm OR 3/4 tsp
7.	Garlic, fresh &amp; peeled - 20 gm OR 1.5 tbsp
8.	Ginger, fresh &amp; peeled - 20 gm OR 1.5 tbsp
9.	Wine Vinegar - 80 gm OR ~ 3 oz 


**For the curry:**
1.	Oil - 3 tbsp
2.	Cinnamon stick - 1 stick
3.	Black Mustard - 2 gm OR 1/4 tsp
4.	Red Onion, finely chopped - 3/4 cup OR 6 oz
5.	Fresh green chilies, slit in the center - 3 -4 pcs
6.	Turmeric - 1.5 tsp
7.	Red chili powder - 2.5 tsp
8.	Salt - 1.5 tsp
9.	Brown sugar OR jaggery - 2 tbsp
10.	Stock - 1/2 cup OR 4 oz [You will need more if you're using a tougher cut of meat like Pork butt ~ 1.5 cups]


##DIRECTIONS:   

1.	Dry roast the whole spices mentioned under “For Marinating”.
2.	When the spices have cooled off a bit, make a paste with ginger, garlic, and wine vinegar.
3.	Marinade the chicken in this paste and store in the fridge for up to 4 hours. If you’re using Pork, lamb, or a tougher cut of meat you can marinade it overnight in the fridge as well.
4.	When the marinating process has about 30 mins left, heat a pan and when the pan is hot, add oil.
5.	Once the oil is hot, add cinnamon stick, mustard seeds, slit green chilies and cook until the mustard crackles. Then, add onions.
6.	Cook onions on medium-low flame to caramelize them,
7.	When the onions are ready, add turmeric, red chili powder and salt and cook for a few mins.
8.	Add the chicken. Cook until half done. Don’t cover the pan to avoid sweating of the meat.
9.	When the chicken is about half done, add brown sugar and mix well.
10.	Add the stock and let the chicken cook fully – pan remains uncovered. But if you are using pork or lamb, you may need to cover the pan and use more than half cup of stock.
11.	The chicken is ready when it is nice and tender. Serve with plain white rice since this is a very flavorful dish!


**Bonus tip:** you can make this the day before; the flavors develop overnight, and the meat becomes much more tender and flavorful. :) Thank you for reading!

**Enjoy this Lentil French Onion Soup recipe. It’s a vegetarian version (no beef broth) but still just as amazing.**

**Ingredients**

* 5 Large Yellow or Sweet Onions Thinly chopped      into half moons
* 3 Tbsp Butter
* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil
* 5 Cloves of Garlic Minced
* 3 Tbsp Flour Optional
* ½ Cup Balsamic Vinegar or Dry Red or White      Wine Can also use Apple Cider Vinegar
* 2 Tsp Worcestershire
* 6 Cups Beef or Vegetable Broth/Stock
* 1½ Cup Lentils Green or Brown
* 1 Bay Leaf
* 2 tsp Dried Thyme Can also use Fresh
* Salt &amp; Pepper to Taste
* Gruyere Cheese Or Swiss, Gouda, Fontina
* French Bread Or any crusty Bread
* 1-3 tbsp of Butter and 1 tsp of fresh minced garlic for      garlic butter ( for bread)

**Instructions**

1. Slice your onions in half. Next cut into thin ""half moon"" slices.

2. Add butter to pan and melt. Now add olive oil and onions and stir. Cook down/caramelize onions for about 30-40 minutes over medium/medium low heat until golden brown. Monitor the onions and be sure to slightly stir for the last 5 minutes to prevent burning.

3. When your onions are about 5 minutes away from being caramelized, add your minced garlic and stir. If you would like to thicken your soup at this point (optional) add 3 tbsp of flour and stir.

4. If you also would like to deglaze pan, add your vinegar or wine to the pan and stir ( making sure to scrape up all the goodies on the bottom of the pan). I highly recommend this step as it helps develop extra flavor for the soup.

5. Now add your stock of choice, Worcestershire, dried thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to look at how much sodium your stock has before adding extra salt to your soup. Add lentils and bring to a boil.

6. Turn heat down to medium low and cover pot. Cook for 20-30 minutes until lentils have softened.

7. Mix minced garlic and slightly softened butter together in a small bowl. Add to your bread slices. If you do not have oven safe bowls, add bread with garlic butter and sliced cheese onto a baking dish and broil until cheese has melted. Place sliced bread on top of soup in your bowl. If you have oven safe bowls, add bread directly to top of soup in bowl with cheese and add bowl to broiler. Broil until slightly golden and melted.

I love these filled cannelloni because you can basically fill them with way more different things and get a great and delicious dinner.
I prefer them with cheese so...

Ingredients:

 - Cannelloni (I had 19 or 20 pieces)
 - 600gr white cheese
 - 200-300gr gouda/edam cheese
 - 150gr creamcheese with onions(or your preferred one)
 - 800ml-1L tomato juice/sauce

Procedure 

Is as simple as it gets. Just mix the cheeses together and fill your cannelloni with it
You can either put the use the simple tomato juice as it is, or pre-pare it before hand for a better result.
To prepare it before hand, put it in a pan, and get it to a simmer/boil. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar to balance that accidity
or a spoon depends on how much you gonna use, add some paprika, smoked paprika, basil, oregano, salt, pepper...or just
customize with your favorite spices.

Then add a layer of tomato juice, put your cannelloni filled with cheese, cover them with more cheese. You can do a double layer like I did
or just cook 1 single layer. I don't really know if there are different sizes of cannelloni out there so you may have
to adjust the amount of ingredients for yourself.

Cover everything with a tin foil and cook into the oven at 180 Celsius for around 20 minutes. Take the foil down
and see if your cannelloni are soft (they should be covered in tomato juice before putting the tin foil).
If they're soft, remove the tin foil, add some cheese on top and cook it for another 5-10 minutes with fan on
until the cheese on top melts or get crispy. And enjoy a warm cheesy meal.

You can pre-boil the cannelloni, let them cool a bit and then fill them with cheese. But I think that's more work and harder to fill them.
So do what you think works better for you.

I hope you gonna enjoy them. 

Sometimes I love to precook some chicken, and add it to the cheese mixture. Or add spinach. Play with different kind of cheese and get different taste.
Is really easy to customize this recipe and get something great out of it.",cookingforbeginners,Easy Cheesy Cannelloni | 2 Salty Recipe,1606647926,7,361,"Easy Cheesy Cannelloni | 2 Salty Recipe If you're looking for some fast and easy dinner, look no further.

I hope you gonna enjoy them. 

Sometimes I love to precook some chicken, and add it to the cheese mixture. Or add spinach. Play with different kind of cheese and get different taste.
Is really easy to customize this recipe and get something great out of it."

ThisIsALineLFC,Question,24,"Note: Sorry, this post is a bit of a combination of sharing my experience and advice and also asking for some advice, so I just flaired it as a Question.

Today I realised I've been overheating my non-stick pan.

I started cooking regularly (every day) about a year ago after being diagnosed with food allergies, etc. I was previously under the impression that it was worthwhile preheating a pan, even non-stick ones, for a minute or two before putting in the food, and because I almost always cook beef or chicken thigh with a good amount of fat, I never really use oil, so I'm always heating it up dry.

I'd researched non-stick coating before because I was previously using a non-stick pan we already had in the kitchen and I'd realised a couple times that bits of coating had flaked off into the food I was eating. Apparently if ingested, it just passes through your system and is mostly harmless.

I've got a new pan now which I've been using for the past few months but apparently, unbeknownst to myself, I was still exposing myself to risk by preheating it dry for a minute or two on low to medium before putting in the food. There have even been a few occasions where I've forgotten to do some prep that I then remember to do and inadvertently had the pan preheating for about 5 mins or even a bit longer before putting the food in.

On the 'positive' side, I've never suffered any apparent ill effects or had symptoms of Teflon flu, and the kitchen window is usually open keeping it ventilated. But even so, I'm going to give up non-stick while giving myself an upgrade by switching to stainless steel. Now that I cook all my own meals, I think it's worth it. I did have a stint trying an enamel pot before getting my current pan - I usually eat once a day, usually a 'one dish meal' consisting mainly of beef with eggs on top, but in the enamel pot the beef at the bottom would often burn before the eggs got cooked. I think this was because of the small surface area of the pot, meaning the eggs were considerably higher away from the heat as compared to a larger pan in which everything was more evenly spread out, preventing the eggs from getting cooked before the beef at the bottom burned. I'm hoping picking the right sized stainless steel pan will prevent similar issues.

Anyway sorry for being long-winded but perhaps this could serve as a heads up for anyone who isn't aware of the precautions to keep in mind when using non-stick cookware. Perhaps some of you have your own similar experiences to share to make me feel a little less stupid about possibly and unknowingly poisoning myself in small doses. Also if anyone has advice with regard to my concerns above about cookware materials and not burning my food.

liliumstarshine,Recipe,2,"*Thanks everyone for letting me know you'd be interested. As this will be a longer one, please bear with me.*

Risotto is one of those dishes that can go with basically anything. There's a whole world of flavours, mainly savoury, that can be incorporated. It's really just a vehicle for creamy, starchy goodness. Here I'm going to go through a basic recipe, cooking process and a couple variations that can be made. 

The first thing to know is the cooking process isn't overly complex, but it requires almost constant attention. Even seasoned cooks/chefs will mess it up from time to time. What I'm saying is, don't walk away for more than a minute if you can avoid it, especially if it's your first time. Just keep stirring.

Secondly, quality ingredients will make a difference. Arborio rice is key along with a well flavoured stock. When buying the rice note that some brands are certified gluten free if cooking for a celiac. Butter and a decent hard cheese are also important, the powdered ones (Kraft, etc) won't cut it this time. This dish *can* be made vegan, but there are sacrifices to make in texture and richness.

\---

# Sweet Pea Risotto

**Equipment Needed:**

* 1 heavy bottom pot for cooking the risotto, stainless is best (4 qt is a good size for this recipe)
* 1 of any pot for holding the stock
* Silicone spatula, 1-2oz ladle, knife, cutting board, tasting spoons

**Ingredients:**

* 500 grams Arborio Rice (1/2 standard package)
* 2 L. Chicken Stock (can sub with veg or pork/ham, steaming hot water is fine if you run out partway)
* 5 Tbsp Butter, cubed
* 1/4-1/2 Yellow or White Onion, fine dice
* 1 Bay Leaf
* 1/4 Cup White Wine (cooking wine is fine)
* 2-3 Tbsp Lemon Juice, as needed
* 1/4 Cup grated Parmesan style cheese (grana padano, asiago, pecorino, parmigiano-reggiano, etc)
* 1-2 Tbsp Fresh Parley, finely chopped
* Sea Salt, as needed
* 1/2 Cup Sweet Peas, thawed from frozen or fresh

**Process:**

1. Warm up your stock in a pot, bringing it to a low simmer and holding it there.
2. In your second pot throw in a tbsp of butter along with the onions and bay leaf. Salt it lightly, then 'sweat' the onions over medium low heat until they're translucent. You don't want any colour on them.
3. Add your rice in and stir it around with the onions, being careful to avoid it sticking, for a couple minutes. This is just to heat it up, depending on your range you can turn down the heat a little.
4. Pour your white wine into the rice pot. This is your first liquid addition. Continue stirring, as the wine heats up it'll begin to absorb into the rice.
5. Once the wine is almost totally absorbed add your first ladle of stock. You'll want to add around 2 ounces at a time for this volume. Continue stirring, watching the heat on the rice pan as it absorbs the stock. You want to maintain a 'low simmer' temperature for the whole cooking process, if it's too cold the liquid won't be absorbed correctly, if it's too hot you'll end up with burning or sticking.
6. Continue adding the stock as described, letting it get almost fully absorbed by the rice each time, still stirring.
7. Eventually you'll reach a point where some of the starch begins to cook out (it will thicken) and the rice doesn't look totally raw anymore. Start tasting a few grains of rice every couple of minutes. They should be quite crunchy at first, but slowly beginning to soften.
8. Once the rice reaches a point of not being crunchy, but is still a little harder than you'd like to eat, you can begin seasoning and adding the rest of the ingredients.
9. Mix in the remaining butter, 1 tbsp at a time. Alternate with the cheese to maintain consistency. You may need to add more stock right away as it will thicken.
10. Stir in the fresh parsley. Add the lemon juice, to taste, some people prefer more or less acidity.
11. Salt as needed for your dish. It should be basically done, but if the risotto isn't as soft as you'd like yet, continue adding stock and cooking it out.
12. Once it's reached the desired consistency and doneness, mix in your peas and heat them gently.
13. Serve immediately, garnish as desired.

**Easy Variations:**

* Sweet Chili and Bacon; Dice Bacon and cook off in a pot until crispy, use bacon fat in place of half the butter. Add sweet chili sauce and bacon bits near the end of the cooking process.
* Mushroom; Re-hydrate your favourite mushroom in some very hot water. Reserve the liquid to add to the risotto, add mushrooms part way through the cooking process.

**To Prep Ahead of Time (Par Cook):**

* Cook the risotto until a little before the part where you'd add the other ingredients. Immediately lay out on a sheet pan and refrigerate to cool, covering later on so it doesn't dry out.
* The next day (or whenever) heat up your stock again, adding the desired amount of par cooked risotto to a separate pot. Start up the cooking process again where you left off.

•Turkey

•1 tbsp. Salt

•1 tbsp. Pepper

•1 tbsp. Onion Powder

•1 tbsp. Garlic Powder

•1 tbsp. Chili Powder

•1 tbsp. Paprika

•1 tbsp. Lemon Pepper Seasoning

•1 tbsp. Italian Seasoning


Directions
Take your thawed turkey and remove excess skin from neck area and back of the turkey. Then with a sharp knife or kitchen shears and cut down 
the middle of the backbone or cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it flip the turkey over and press down hard on the breast until it cracks open to lay down flat on the board. Take a napkin and pat the inside and outside of the skin dry.
To a bowl add your salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, lemon pepper seasoning and Italian seasoning and mix them all together. Spread the seasoning all over the turkey inside and out and also under the skin. Take some soften butter and rub over the breast under the skin. Once the chicken is seasoned place it on a baking tray and place in the refrigerator overnight uncovered to allow it to dry out as much as possible. The next day light your grill and place on the grill over a raised rack at 400 degrees. Use your thermometer and cook until the turkey read 165 in the thickest part of the thigh and chicken breast. This 14 lb turkey took one hour and 45 mins to cook.

Spread the seasoning all over the turkey inside and out and also under the skin. Take some soften butter and rub over the breast under the skin. Once the chicken is seasoned place it on a baking tray and place in the refrigerator overnight uncovered to allow it to dry out as much as possible. The next day light your grill and place on the grill over a raised rack at 400 degrees. Use your thermometer and cook until the turkey read 165 in the thickest part of the thigh and chicken breast. This 14 lb turkey took one hour and 45 mins to cook. Removed from the grill and let rest for 30 mins to an hour before slicing."

QUICK And EASY Salmon Teriyaki Recipe l How To Make Salmon Teriyaki Recipe Under 10 Minutes Step By Step Guide

1)  Grab a knob of ginger and grate 1 to 2 teaspoons of ginger. Gather the ginger in a small bowl, give it a good pinch and squeeze out all the ginger juice.

2)  Grab a slab of salmon and start to run your fingers through the flesh. When you find any bones, use a pair of kitchen tweezers or a kitchen serviette to remove it. Repeat until all bones have been removed.

3)  Before we slice up our salmon, we want each slice to be around half an inch thick. Start to visualise how thick each slice should be and lightly score the surface of the salmon to give yourself a guiding mark.

4)  Next, start cutting each slice of salmon along the guiding marks. This will help make sure your salmon fillets are of the same thickness so that they cook at the same rate.

5)  Dry the salmon fillets with some kitchen serviettes.

6)  Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of corn starch in a small sieve and evenly dust the corn starch over the salmon and lightly pat the corn starch onto the salmon. Flip the salmon fillets and repeat so that both sides are coated.

7)  Heat your pan on medium heat and add a thin layer of vegetable oil to help prevent the salmon fillets from sticking. Add your salmon fillets (lay them down away from you to avoid splatters) when the pan is hot.

8)  Fry the salmon fillets for about 2-3 minutes and flip the salmon. Repeat for the other side. You want to achieve a nice thin layer of crust. Turn off the heat and remove the salmon fillets from the pan and once ready.

9)  As the salmon tends to release a lot oil when cooked, you may want to remove the excess oil in the pan. You can do so by pouring the oil away or using some kitchen paper.

10) Add about 3 to 4 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce and the ginger juice to the pan. 

11) Heat the sauce on a medium low heat and let it reduce in the pan gently. Be careful not to let the sugars in the teriyaki sauce burn.

12) When you have achieved the consistency you are looking for. You can either pour the sauce over the teriyaki salmon, or you can add the teriyaki salmon back into the pan to coat it further. 

13) Serve and enjoy!",cookingforbeginners,https://youtu.be/uGk_TT9WtN4,1606532783,1,427,"https://youtu.be/uGk_TT9WtN4 Full Video at: https://youtu.be/uGk\_TT9WtN4

bakedbeans18,Recipe,5,"Hi r/cookingforbeginners. With American Thanksgiving coming up I wanted to give my tips on how to ensure you get crispy skin on your roasted turkeys/chicken/ducks/etc. It really boils down to 3 tips as follows that I plan on making a video for. But in the meantime, here's a quick writeup of the process:

* Hot Water Scalding
   * I know it seems weird, but this is a trick that cooks in China use for peking duck to get that golden brown, crackling skin. They boil water, and pour large spoonfuls of it over the bird.
   * What this does is render the collagen in the skin into gelatin. The problem with collagen when roasting is that it hold onto moisture and fat, leading to soggy skin. By cooking the skin a bit now, we accelerate the process. When doing this the skin will visibly contract a bit, but that's not a huge issue.
* Dry Skin
   * So after scalding the skin, we need to dry it out. Excess moisture will not lead to crispiness, it'll have the opposite effect. We just poured hot water onto the skin adding moisture to it. While this helps, we now need to dry that hot water up after it partially cooks the skin.
   * Either thoroughly dab the bird with paper towels, making sure to get all the nooks and crannies that roast birds are infamous for. Or stick the bird in the fridge overnight uncovered. The heating cycle in the fridge is fantastic for drying out foods exposed to that air. 
   * Cold air doesn't hold water as well as warm air; so when the air in the fridge is warmed a bit (this happens in all fridges, air temp fluctuates up and down) it absorbs moisture from the food. Once the fridge starts to cool the air, that moisture in the air is lost to the outside. But the air will heat up over time, once again pulling moisture from the food - effectively drying out the bird
* High Heat
   * Maillard reactions, or browning start happening at 310F/154C. This means the surface of the food needs to reach that temp, and because air is a poor conductor of heat, the oven's temp must be much higher than 310C/154C.
   * I recommend 400F/200C or higher, as this is hot enough to ensure the fat renders out and maillard browning, aka crispiness in the skin, can occur.
   * Rubbing the skin with oil can also help as oils are much better at heat transfer than air, and a uniform coating of oil can help with even browning.

As stated above, I'm going to make a video of this to help demonstrate. Will post it later, but wanted to get the info out there first.

zippopwnage,Recipe,2,"After making my applesauce cake, I really needed to try some other sweets with that. So I made Applesauce Blondies with Caramel!

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/hTWl6OK)

Ingredients :

 - 420gr flour
 - 400gr lightbrown sugar
 - 250gr applesauce
 - 340gr melted butter
 - 15gr vanilla sugar
 - 7-10ml vanilla essence
 - 5gr baking powder
 - 100gr white chocolate
 - pinch of salt

for caramel I used : 

 - 200gr sugar
 - 60gr butter
 - 50ml water
 - 200ml heavy cream
 - pinch of salt

Procedure: 

Cut the chocolate in small pieces or big, and have them in the freezer until we prepare the rest. 

So this is as easy as it gets. Mix sugar, vanilla sugar, melted butter until combined. Add applesauce, vanilla essence and mix again.
Then mix flour with baking powder, pinch of salt and then add it to your composition. I mixed everything with a whisk so I won't get lumps.
Now add the white chocolate fold it in and then spread your batter into a baking tray that has parchment paper on it.

For the caramel. I know this may be scary for lots of people, but...there's nothing scary about it, except some VERY HIGH HEAT SUGAR THAT'S BOILING
AND READY TO MELT YOUR KITCHEN! But don't worry, that sugar is staying in the pot, it won't jump on you. I hope.
Anyway, you get a pot with a thick bottom and put the sugar with the water in it. Don't do anything else to it except a LITTLE shake.
Put it on a medium-high heat and let it sit. DON'T TOUCH IT! Literally let it sit until you get the caramel color you want. I don't use temps for this.
For me when it gets a little darker brown is perfect. You stop the heat when you get the nice color, then I added butter mix it well and then heavy cream + salt.
Mix it again. I put it back on medium heat for around 30 seconds - 1 minute. Enjoy your caramel.

There are lots of different recipes of caramel. If you don't like mine just use others. I've seen people that put heavy cream first, and finish with a little
butter in the end off heat and then is done. There are people that mix the sugar while is cooking a lot. There are people that put more water and so on.

One thing is to know, don't worry if you get crystallization in your caramel. Making it for the first time is not necessary the easiest thing to achieve
perfection. You can totally eat it if has a little crystallization and enjoy it. I personally don't mind it. You can also try to get it back on the right
consistency by adding a little more water and put it on the heat while mixing. Whatever you do, don't put lemon juice in it. I've seen tips that if you get crystallization
you put it back on the heat and add lemon juice. For me, that will ruin the caramel. It gets a weird taste. Caramel with lemon doesn't work well, not for me.
I like my caramel, but I will still try to make other recipes.

Anyway, I hope you gonna make these and enjoy them. I will try to find other ways to use applesauce even more.

2. Scoop desired amount of yogurt onto the coffee filter. Tear off some plastic wrap (being sure to get it all stuck to itself annoyingly) and press it down onto the yogurt. Try to make sure the plastic wrap is touching all of the top surface of the yogurt. Place the apparatus in the fridge.

TheNiceWriter,Recipe,2,"I’m brand new to cooking, and I’ve been trying small slow subtle cooking experiments.

The idea is to start very simple and make the same thing every time with 1 small change,

I started with a plain cheese quesadilla in a rice tortilla cooked in coconut oil. That was my base. It was very basic.

Next time I cooked I added pan fried ground Turkey. It was rather dry.

The next time I cooked, I made a spice blend sauce for the turkey. Hot sauce, pepper, 2 different chili powders, garlic and onion powder, and cayenne. It didn’t seem like enough liquid, so I added water too, which proved to be a mistake.

I doused the turkey in the liquid, stirred to combine, cooked the meat and used the meat in the quesadillas.

The water washed out any real spice and it tasted kinda gross and bland.

The next time I cooked, I added more hot sauce and lemon juice instead of water, and the results were much better.

The spice really came through, but it was a warm heat like the sun that stayed in your mouth and tasted quite good with the cheese and crunchy warm rice tortilla. The coconut oil was really good with all this.

I don’t know if that’s a common thing people do or not, but I really liked it. Maybe I’m just crazy and adding lemon juice to meat is gross. I don’t know. I didn’t research it.

So...recipe right?

Ingredients :

 - Pork chops      
 - 1 red bell pepper (to taste)
 - half red onion (to taste)
 - 2tbs Dijon Mustard
 - 1-2tbs honey
 - 1/2 corn starch
 - 1/2 lemon or 1 lime
 - 1 instant noodle soup with pork spices
 - 3-4 garlic cloves
 - some butter

(to taste means that you can put less or more, is not a deal breaker) 

Procedure :

Ok so, in my experience, pork chops without bone are not the most tender meat you can get. But
to make it tender, I personally marinade it for 1-2 hours in orange or pineapple juice, then wash it a little
and then put a dry rub on it, let it sit for 1 hour at room temp and then cook it. Never cook it cold.
With this one I skipped the marinade, but it was ok. 

You should make your noodle soup. I think that's pretty simple to make and don't need any instructions. Just make sure after you're done with it, separate the noodles from the soup.

So, for cooking pork chops. I had a dry rub that had (2tsp white pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, 1tsp of paprika, black pepper and very little nutmeg)
You want some hot oil in a pan (I used vegetable oil), and cook the pork chops for around 3 to 4 minutes on each side depending on their thickness THICC.
I personally love when they get a crust. Don't move them when you put them in the pan. Another thing for making them tender is that when you flip them, cook for 1 minute at the same heat, and then put a lid on and go for low-medium flame.
It will lose some crunch from the curst, but you will get them tender. Another way to cook them is to give them a fast crust on each side, and then put them in the oven. I don't think that's needed tough. Anyway when you flip them, put some butter in
and the cloves of garlic. Remove the garlic when they're done.

After you're done cooking them, put the pan on low flame or off the flame for a few seconds. Throw in your diced bell pepper, let it cook for a few seconds, then throw in your small diced onion. Cook at low flame for around 1 minute or so.
Then the weird part, but trust me, it is REALLY good. Put the noodle soup in, along with the mustard, honey, lemon/lime juice and some of that dry rub spices. Let it simmer/boil a little. You want to reduce it a little but not all the way.
I'd say after it gets to simmer, let it at medium heat for around 1 minute.
At this point mix half of teaspoon of corn starch with a splash of water in another bowl, and then put it in the sauce to make it thicker. I do this because I want more sauce. Reducing too much of it, isn't gonna help me here if I need more.
Mix it and let it simmer for half of minute, and then put the pork chops back for another minute. Sprinkle some cilantro and you're done. Let the pork chop rest for 5 minutes before cutting it.

Put the noodles in a plate, cut the pork chops, put it on top of the noodles, put more sauce and enjoy!

xYigx,Recipe,6,"Hello. Here is a super easy holiday recipe that you can surprise your family with. Sweet breads are some of the easiest ways to start learning about baking or just a easy reliable way to make snacks. 

This is a pumpkin sweetbread and aside from a bit of patience the only things you'll need are a large bowl a hand mixer and loaf pans and the following ingredients. You can make this three to four days in advance without the bread drying out by wrapping the loaf in tinfoil, plastic wrap or a tea towel during storage.

 Pumpkin bread  


ing

* 3 cups all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon  
1 tsp nutmeg  
1 tsp all spice\*  
1 tsp ground clove\*  
1tsp ground ginger\*  
3 eggs  
1 cup vegetable oil  
2 ¼ cups white sugar  
1 teaspoons vanilla extract  
15-16 oz pumpkin puree  


Grease and flour 2 8 x 4 pans(or freeze half)  
Mix and/or sift dry ingredients together  
combine  the wet and dry ingredients with the pumpkin and mix with a hand mixer  for about 3 to 5 minutes or until smooth. Put half in each baking pan or freeze half for a easy treat for later. place pan(s) in an oven preheated to 400  degrees. Turn down to 350 degrees and bake for 50 to 65 minutes or until a toothpick  comes out clean.

&amp;#x200B;

If you freeze the batter it will be slightly denser but looses noting in flavor and its honestly not to much different than unfrozen. The batter being super thick is doing some heavy lifting here by keeping most of the bubbles in even during freezing. Also make sure the batter is at room temperature before baking or the middle will not be done before the outsides are way dried out.

&amp;#x200B;

 \* = These are optional. The recipe is designed to give the flavors and impression of pumpkin pie. These are used in a lot of pumpkin pie recipes and help the sweetbread be more than just ""banana bread but with pumpkin. But the pumpkin bread is still great even if you don't have some or all of these.

The reason you want a hand mixer is because the batter from this is going to be very thick. Even with the variances of how wet your pumpkin is and how densely packed your flour is this recipe makes a super thick batter. But since it is so dense we can use the hand mixer to mix in extra bubbles and give the final product a much lighter texture and smaller crumb structure.

But what if you don't have a hand mixer? Well as long as you hate your forearms and don't mind an extra step. Although it will be denser in texture than you would get with the hand mixer but will still taste great. To do this you will need an extra bowl and a whisk. You will need to combine your eggs, sugar and vanilla extract and whip them until the mixture goes from yellow in color to a very pale yellow. This fading of the color is from the bubbles your mixing in, this step will take about five to eight minutes by hand. In the other bowl you will need to sift all your dry ingredients and mix them together until the color of the powder is uniform. Once uniform in color add the remaining wet ingredients and mix until nearly smooth. Once almost smooth gently mix the egg mixture into your batter one third at a time. Since the mixture is liquid you can't really fold the ingredients together but as long as you are gentle with the mixing you will retain a good amount of the bubbles you whipped in and this will get the texture close to what you would get with a hand mixer.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah neat side note. With a batter this thick you can ""draw"" on the top with a sharp knife and the pattern will usually be where the top cracks so you can decorate a bit. It is still baking though so think of it more as a suggestion for where your bread cracks rather than a guaranteed pattern in the final product.",cookingforbeginners,Pumpkin bread super easy holiday sweetbread,1605755826,6,725,"Pumpkin bread super easy holiday sweetbread Hello.

You will need to combine your eggs, sugar and vanilla extract and whip them until the mixture goes from yellow in color to a very pale yellow. This fading of the color is from the bubbles your mixing in, this step will take about five to eight minutes by hand. In the other bowl you will need to sift all your dry ingredients and mix them together until the color of the powder is uniform. Once uniform in color add the remaining wet ingredients and mix until nearly smooth. Once almost smooth gently mix the egg mixture into your batter one third at a time. Since the mixture is liquid you can't really fold the ingredients together but as long as you are gentle with the mixing you will retain a good amount of the bubbles you whipped in and this will get the texture close to what you would get with a hand mixer.

Oh yeah neat side note. With a batter this thick you can ""draw"" on the top with a sharp knife and the pattern will usually be where the top cracks so you can decorate a bit. It is still baking though so think of it more as a suggestion for where your bread cracks rather than a guaranteed pattern in the final product."

southerngentleman90,Recipe,72,"Carnitas are incredible and I love making them the traditional way, which is to fry them and slow cook them in lard. However, sometimes I don't have lard on hand or easily available and let's be honest, I'm also very lazy. You can absolutely make this with sautee'd onions and garlic. You can for sure fry up the carnitas for a little extra texture. But you don't have to in order to have fall-apart, delicious pork. And if someone bullies you for using a basic recipe, let me know and I'll give them a stern talking-to.

&amp;#x200B;

Slow Cooker Carnitas

Ingredients:

\- 3-5 Pounds pork shoulder, cut into a few chunks

\- 3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil

\- 6-8 ounces Mexican Coke (the kind you drink)\*

\- 2 tablespoons citrus juice (orange, lime, or lemon)

\- 2 teaspoons garlic powder (or 6 cloves of crushed fresh garlic)

\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground Cumin

\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Chile Powder

\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Onion Powder

\- 1 teaspoon dried Oregano

\- 4 teaspoons salt

\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

	\*Be sure it's the kind with Cane Sugar, not Corn Syrup. If needed, sub in broth

Instructions:

\- Divide pork shoulder into chunks so that it can fit into your slow cooker or pot.

\- Coat the bottom of the pot with oil and toss in the pork shoulder. Spread remaining oil over the meat to coat evenly. Generously add seasonings, mixing and rubbing as you go, until all of the meat is covered.

\- Mix in the citrus and Mexican Coke (or broth). The meat should be about halfway covered.

\- Cook on low for about 6 hours, or high for about 3 hours until the pork easily shreds.

\- Enjoy!

**Notes:**

\- This is the lazy version. If you feel sassy and want to take them up a notch, roast the pork (before slow cooking) at 450f in a high-rimmed baking sheet (it will release a lot of juices) for 15-20 minutes, or until it's developed a browned crust. Then add the pork along with the juices into the slow cooker or pot.

\- Another option is to quickly pan fry the pork after it finishes cooking. And I mean quickly, otherwise you'll lose all of that tenderness you put in all that work for. Well, not physical work, this is super easy. I mean the work it takes to smell it cooking all day and refrain from digging in early.",cookingforbeginners,Here's my lazy one-pot Carnitas recipe.

camelfarmer1,Recipe,5,"Hi all, I'm a Sri Lankan who moved to England when I was 18 and mostly taught myself how to cook. My mum taught me a few basics before I left home, and of course the internet was my next teacher. I'm now 33 and live in Australia. So I've had 15 years of practice cooking curry.  

There are many different variations of Lentil Dhal, endemic to the different regions of India, Sri Lanka, and the surrounding countries, as well as version from Africa and the Middle East.

Because of the lack of proper teaching, and the difficulty in getting certain ingredients, my dhal is now a hybrid of a few different recipes and methods.

This is how I do it. There will be many other ways, and you can miss out a few ingredients and it should still be good.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fry up the following in a mix of coconut and sunflower oil, add in this order, fry till browned off most of the way: ginger (diced), red onion, garlic, mustard seeds
2. Add some curry powder and lightly fry/roast it, this step will only take a few seconds to a minute
3. Add coconut or full fat milk, or a combination of the two
4. Add the split red lentils, they do not need to be soaked or prepped, just straight in
5. Keep the lentils covered with the milk, add water as required as the lentils soak up the liquid
6. Add these spices: tumeric, cinnamon, garam masala, star anise, cloves, cardamoms, paprika, salt (don't worry if you don't have all of these)
7. Add these greens things: pandan leaf, a handful of curry leaves (dried or fresh), a small bit of bay leaf (don't worry if you don't have all of these)
8. Simmer for about half an hour and then take the lid off and simmer further untill the lentils are cooked and the excess water has evaporated. A tiny bit of sticking at the bottom of the pan is ok, but you may need to keep stiring and scraping to stop burning. A little burning will add a little flavor, but too much and it will taste bitter
9. You may have to add more salt and this takes a lot of salt to bring out the flavors, you can add chili you want it to be spicy

And there you have it. Vegetarian (and vegan if you use coconut milk), cheap, and quite easy once you've done it a couple of times. It takes longer to cook than you would think. So if you're doing another curry with it, get it going early so you can put it on a back burner and let it simmer and stir as you go.

cabinantlers,Question,10,"***TL;DR: I cooked pasta with chicken breast and veggies. Although I used fairly standard ingredients, I ended up with a dish that, albeit being relatively tastey, has given me absurd amounts of stomach cramps and left me damn hungry, even after the second portion. I'm frustrated and want to know where I screwed up, so this is a lesson for all future times I'll venture to cook sautées again.***Hey there. I'm not particularly good with cooking in general. I know how to do a simple particular dishes very well (babaganoush, complex, national stews, mashed potatoes and a few more), and other dishes like chicken w/ potatoes in the oven I make decently.

However, there are some things which I keep f\*cking up for a long while now: sautés in any combinations. I actually wanted to wait until tomorrow to post this, but my stomach is so upset after eating my own pasta that I got major pissed and just decided to post it now. I need to know what I'm doing wrong, I can't stand this anymore.

So what I cooked just about 5 hours ago was pasta with chicken and legumes. The ingredients:- 1 onion- 1 big carrot- 1 red bell pepper- 7-8 white mushrooms- 1/3 of a big zucchini- 3 gloves of garlic- 2 cans of 250g canned tomato pieces- 500-600g of chicken breast- 400g tagliatelle pasta- salt, pepper, sweet paprika, dry parsley, dry thyme, dry coriander, dry basil, garlic powder, soy sauce

I started off by slicing my onion into tiny cubes and put all of them aside, in a container. I sliced the red pepper into \~1 cm long, 0.5 cm wide pieces, and grated my carrot on the scraper, in thin medium stripes. Put these aside too, in a different container. Then I continued chopping up the mushrooms in slices, and the zucchini I cut longitudinally in quarters, which gave me quarter pieces when slicing.

The chicken I cut into small cubes and marinated it with about a spoonful of olive oil, more than a spoon of mustard, salt, pepper, some lemon juice. I mixed it all well in its original packaging, left it in the fridge, and continued preparing the rest of the stuff for the next \~20 mins. At some point I also put a lot of water to boil in a different container - added salt and just a touch of olive oil to it.

Meanwhile, I heated up my pan, waited for it to get hot, put about 1 full spoon of butter in. I added the onion and mixed throughly on high temp for about 3-4 mins, until the onion was translucent and beginning to barely enter the browning stage. I was adding some salt and pepper to it, too. I then added all of the chicken and proceeded to mix it around. It was probably \~10 mins until all of the meat was white and already kind of boiling in its own juices. At this stage I was also adding more salt/pepper to the mix, followed by some garlic powder, the sweet paprika powder, dry parsley and about 2 tbsps of soy sauce.

Soon enough, I realized this pan won't be big enough for the final mixture, so I took out a bigger, wider one, about 6 cms tall and with a ""straight"" angle between the walls and the base. I put it on the same heater spot and poured all of the mixture into it. When I tasted what I had so far, the flavors seemed way too sweet, bright, eccentric and mixed in a displeasing fashion (think of smelling a strong lilac perfume on someone that's also mixed with a sweet, woody scent and a third pine perfume, all on top of a natural sweat smell - that would be a close analogy). I was surprized to actually faintly taste the mustard I had used for marinating the chicken, alongside another distinct sharp and unfitting taste - a taste you might expect in sweeter Thai food perhaps, but it was just bad in this combo. Could it have been the sweet paprika? That was less than a full tablespoon. Maybe the thyme? That could've been 1-2 tbsps. The dry parsley seemed to daft and proper when I re-tasted it on its own, just to check.

Regardless, from that point forward, I decided I needed to repair this early error by straying away from exotic, bright and sweet flavors and trying to cover it all up with more basic, robust, ground-like flavors: salt, pepper, garlic powder. So, as the cooking went on, I added those things a few more times in turns, tasting and verifying how it's progressing each time.

After the chicken, it was already time for the bell peppers and carrot. I dumped them into the pan and continued to stir on high temp (at some point, I thought/realized I should switch to medium temp, and so I did). I wasn't all throughout stirring, for example, at certain moments I was doing other stuff like cleaning up after previous steps or washing a ustensil, but I think I gave it enough stirring overall. I really tried to avoid overcooking it from my past bad experiences, but this is where I think I failed: the sauté I had so far was arguably more shrunk and ""mashed"" than what it would look like when my girlfriend cooks random veggies together (and she's an excellent cook). The bell peppers and carrot probably stayed in the pan for about 10 more minutes (or even more?).

I initially wanted to next dump the zucchini first and the mushrooms last, but seeing how far the ingredients were already cooked and beginning to mash togethe, I said screwed it and dumped both the zucchini + shrooms together, to compensate. I also quickly peeled 2 medium cloves of garlic, grated them into a mushy paste-like and added that to the mixture (this being after having added dashes of garlic powder little by little already, in about 3 sittings). I also have to mention that I was worried my mixture wouldn't cook at a high enough temperature, so at 2 different points I kind of pushed the stuff a little and left an empty spot in the pan where I poured about 1-2 spoons of regular sunflower oil, left it to heat up and bubble for like 30 secs, and only then mixed it in the rest of the ingredients. The mixture was pretty big and tall already, so this didn't make it noticeably oilier at all, but I don't know if it helped in any way either.

Anyway, the zucchini and mushroom pieces only had their own \~5-10 minutes of fame in the pot cause I wanted to at least have something which wasn't too overcooked. I tested them and they seemed to be just the right ratio of penetrated by heat vs. resembling their original shape. When I had began cooking, I also wasn't sure if I was gonna complete the mixture with rice or pasta, but now it was already looking to point towards pasta. Because I needed to tie everything together somehow, I took out two 250g of tomatoes (one of them with diced pieces, one of them with full pieces). I added them to the pan and broke up the full tomatoes in the pan with the wooden ustensil, to make halfs of thirds of them. Stirred some more and decided to add another grated clove of garlic, just because I wasn't ""feeling"" it (this later turned out to be a lie).

Also, in the meantime my water had already started to boil, so at least this was pretty good timing. About the time when I was dumping the tomato pieces in the pan, I also put the pasta in the water. Made sure to stir it with the special pasta-grabbing ustensil from time to time, but there was no danger of it sticking anyway, because of the salt and olive oil. Around 9-10 mins later, after adding the final touches to the pan (some more salt &amp; pepper + 1-2 tbsps of dry basil and mixing from time to time, as it was on med heat), the pasta seems done. So I take it and pour it in the pan, on top of the sauté and chicken, being careful to drip out any excess water. I stir the whole thing up for about 5 more minutes on low heat and that was it.

And now, to the annoying part: when I ate it, the taste seemed good. It looks like I did manage to cover up the overly eccentric mistakes from the beginning, but the food is still a bit odd in terms of flavor. The stripes of carrot aren't visible anymore, and the mushrooms are also hard to find due to overcooking. The most ""intact"" pieces are the zucchini, which also seems to be the most properly cooked of them all. Adding the basil turned out to be a good idea, as it livened up the whole tomatoey dish and completed it nicely. But the garlic was over the top. It didn't hit me right away, but after I eat I'm left with a strong, persistent garlic aftertaste. I realized it's too much. And after I ate a second portion about 2-3 hrs later, I identified the garlic even faster: it's there and it's towering over the other flavors. This wouldn't even bother me too much, I like to eat condimented food - if it weren't for the aftertaste.

Needless to say, after both the first and second portion I am left with cramps and a very upset stomach. I was envisioning this kind of scenario, especially after more than 5 years of f\*cking up most of my sautés, but holy heck I didn't think it would be this bad. In fact, the second round of cramps during my second portion started as I was still eating. I had tried to get rid of the problem by going to the problem a while after the first portion, and it kind of worked, mostly. It's just that I got hungy and had to resort to pasta again some time later. I think I have a fast metabolism, so this isn't uncommon for me. I'm a big eater, so the first portion would prolly be 1.5 portions of what a regular guy would eat. However, 3 hours later I am hungry almost as if I didn't know that I even ate (apart from the kind reminders sent by the stomach). And now, just \~an hour after the second portion, I feel that I am hungry once more! All the while having obvious ridiculous stomach gargling. It's in the same vein as the Subway effect, when you eat a 12-inch sandwich and an hour later you're magically hungry again.

So to summarize, I'm really pissed at myself, and, even more than pissed, I am amazed: how could I have f\*cked up such a seemingly uncomplicated dish, with such standards ingredients, so badly? How is it giving me these silly ass cramps, even though it technically tastes all right? Was it the overcooking of some or all of the ingredients? Was it excess garlic powder or garlic cloves? Was it too many/unsuited spices? Was it the manner of cooking? Paying to little or too much attention to stirring? High temp when low was needed?

If you wish to enlighten and help a poor soul, I'd much appreciate it. Also, sorry for the long post, this got out of hand as anger was flowing through my intestines.",cookingforbeginners,Any advice so I stop screwing up my sautées?,1605580772,9,1919,"Any advice so I stop screwing up my sautées? ***TL;DR: I cooked pasta with chicken breast and veggies.

2)  Start heating it on low and stir continuously with a whisk. Make sure to scrap any cookie butter that may stick to the bottom of the pot so that it doesn’t burn. Continue until steam starts to form and everything is well combined then kill the heat. Do not let the milk come to a boil.

3)  Prepare 1 to 2 shots of espresso. I used my nespresso machine in the video because I currently do not own an espresso machine (though I would like to one day!).

4)  Combine the cookie butter milk mixture and coffee in a cup. Garnish with whipped cream and a piece of Lotus biscuit. You can crush the biscuits in advance and sprinkle it on top of the whipped cream.

5)  Enjoy!"

usefulmuse,Question,12,"I want to preface this by saying that we don't normally celebrate Thanksgiving. Not for any particular reason, my parents were simply both immigrants and never saw a reason to celebrate it. This year, however, my dad is getting a free turkey at work and I've decided to try my hand at cooking a traditional Thanksgiving meal for us. I'm pretty confident in being able to cook each dish individually as I've made everything (besides the turkey and stuffing) once or twice before. The only problem is, I have no idea when or in what order I should make everything. 

Some info:

1. The dishes I want to make are the turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. (I'm gonna buy the pie and cranberry sauce to save time.)
2. I know I need to give the turkey a few days to thaw and I plan to brine it overnight the night before

Party-Permission,Question,2," 

I recently made Brigadeiros, a Brazilian chocolate-fudge kind of dessert, which uses only

sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder and a little butter which was really easy and worked well.

The  result was pretty close to fudge and much easier than making fudge than  what I'd previously tried. Now I was wondering if I could use maple  syrup instead of cocoa powder.

Would that work? Meaning would that also thicken to a fudge-like consistency through simmering heat as it does with the cocoa?

Thanks!

Recipe from [https://braziliankitchenabroad.com/brigadeiro/](https://braziliankitchenabroad.com/brigadeiro/)

Ingredients

* 1x 14oz can of sweet condensed milk
* 1/2 cup chocolate powder, such as Nescau or Nesquik
* 1 Tbsp margarine, or butter (plus more for hands)
* Sprinkles

Instructions

* Add the condensed milk, the butter, and the chocolate powder to a medium sauce pan and stir.
* Cook   over medium heat, for approximately 10 mins, stirring repeatedly,   scraping the sides and the bottom of the pan with a spatula to avoid   burning.
* The   brigadeiro is ready when you scrape the bottom of the pan, and the   brigadeiro takes 2-3 seconds to come back to its place, or when the   mixture reaches 205F-208F – You can use a candy thermometer, or just a   regular food thermometer to check.
* Pour the hot brigadeiro into a a dish, or plate, and let it cool – about 2 hours.
* Meanwhile, pour sprinkles in a deep plate or bowl.
* When the brigadeiro is cooled, butter your hands, and scoop 1/2 Tbsp to Tbsp portions and roll little balls.
* Roll the little balls in the sprinkles.
* Keep them in a cool place or in the refrigerator until serving time.",cookingforbeginners,Question about using Sweetened Condensed Milk to make Fudge-like Dessert,1605218260,10,278,"Question about using Sweetened Condensed Milk to make Fudge-like Dessert

Ingredients:

2 tablespoons of butter

3 tablespoons of white flour

1 Cup of milk (whole or low-fat)

3-5 slices of cheese (Use a generic one, but the best would be parmigiano, for which you should use 1/4 of a cup)

The old and migthy duo of salt and pepper

Preparation:

In low heat, melt the butter and after it liquidfies, add the flour and mix until you get a very cohesive sand-like paste. Afterwards, start adding your milk slowly while dissolving the paste on it, you will notice that it the paste gets mixed upon the milk and it starts thickening. After you incorporated all the milk, toss in your cheese and depending on how your mix consistency and taste feels like, add more milk or cheese, milk for liquifying or cheese to thicken. Keep in mind that your sauce should be a bit more liquid that you would like, because the lipids in the sauce will start to solidify, passively thickening your sauce as is on your plate.

The dense texture, no eggs...make this cake really good

You can also find a recipe video on there.

-Apple Sauce-

 - 4 Apples (around 700gr of apple cubes)
 - Lemon juice from 1 lemon
 - 10gr of vanilla sugar
 - Cinnamon Stick
 - A splash of water

Bring to boil with a lid on, then after 5 minutes remove the lid, and let it boil a little more until everything is soft and mushy.
Remove the cinnamon stick and blend the rest. You have apple sauce! Let it cool down before using it.

-Apple Sauce Cake-

 - 3cups flour 
 - 10gr baking powder
 - 1tsp baking soda
 - 1tsp cinnamon
 - 3tbsp vinegar
 - 2cups milk
 - 2cups applesauce (the applesauce recipe I gave you should give you enough. For me it was exactly 2 cups of applesauce. To be sure you can add 1-2 more apples to that recipe)
 - 2cups sugar
 - 250gr butter
 - mascarpone and whipping heavy cream for cream

Start by mixing flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon in a bowl. In a separate one, start mixing
milk, sugar, applesauce, vinegar, butter until combined.
Now add the dry ingredients to your wet ones and mix well.

Distribute the batter in 2 baking pans. I suggest having the base a little thicker than the top. 
Cook for around 25-30 minutes at 180°C. Do a toothpick taste to be sure is done. 
The cake will look like is not cooked inside because it is not spongy at all. It is moist and dense.
But on the outside you should see browning. 

Don't take your cakes out of the baking pan until they get a 5-10 minutes rest. Then transfer to a cooking rack
to completely cool down

For the cream, you mix with a mixer whipping heavy cream until you get whipping cream that sticks in shape. In another bowl
mix the mascarpone cheese with a mixer, and then add it to the whipping cream and mix it again with a mixer until 
maintaining shape. I did not added any sugar to this, because the cake is already sweet enough and the whipping cream is usually sweet.
If you want it more sweet, you can add some powder sugar in the mascarpone cheese.",cookingforbeginners,Applesauce Cake,1605008210,2,387,"Applesauce Cake So this is the best cake I ever ate. Seriously. The apple taste with the cinnamon from the cake is really amazing.

Another version involves much more aggressive browning and caramelization to develop a deep fond, and red wine is used. The end product looks deeper in color and very bold in flavor.

Tender and flaky fish in a crispy beer batter with the ultimate homemade Tartar Sauce! Takes less than 20 minutes to make both! Enjoy! Just so you can see how quick and EASY this is to make, step by step recipe video available upon request.

Recipe: 

Ingredients for the Beer Battered Fish: 

Cod or Tilapia - 2 pounds
AP flour - 1.5 cups 
Baking Powder - 1 tsp
Old Bay Seasoning - 1 tsp
Smoked Paprika - 1 tsp
1.5 Bottles of Beer 

Ingredients for the Ultimate Tartar Sauce: 

Mayonnaise - 1/2 of a cup
Sour Cream - 2 Tbsp
Vinegar - 1 tsp
Capers - 1 Tbsp
Garlic - 1 Clove
Cornichons or Dill Pickles - 3 Tablespoons chopped
A few sprigs of Dill
A few sprigs of Parsley
A few dashes of Cayenne pepper 
Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Pat the Cod dry with a paper towel. 
If you can't get cod, this recipe also works great with tilapia. 
Season the fish with salt and pepper on both sides. Let the fish sit while you prepare the batter. 
Batter Recipe: 1.5 cups of all purpose Flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Sift them together. Add a heaping teaspoon of old bay seasoning, a teaspoon of smoked paprika and a big pinch of salt. Whisk to combine. 
Gradually add 1.5 bottles of beer while whisking until you reach the consistency of pancake batter.
Tartar Sauce Recipe:
In a bowl add 1/2 of a cup of Mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of sour cream, a teaspoon of vinegar, 1 clove of garlic using a garlic press, 1 tablespoon of Capers - drained, black pepper, a small pinch of salt and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Mix to combine. 
Chop some cornishons which are just basically baby Dill pickles. You can also use regular Dill pickles as well. You will need about 3 tablespoons chopped.  
Chop a few sprigs of Dill and a few sprigs of parsley. About 1 tablespoon of each. Add the herbs to the bowl and whisk to combine. 
Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator while you fry your fish. 

Heat Vegetable oil or Canola oil on medium heat. You want the temperature between 350 and 375 degrees. Using a pair of tongs, dip your fish in the batter until evenly coated. Slowly lower the fish into the oil. Only fry a couple of pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding otherwise the temperature of the oil will drop too low and the fish will end up steaming instead of frying. The fish fries quickly so keep an eye on it. It only takes about 4-5 minutes depending on the thickness. 

Use a skimmer or a large slotted spoon to remove the fish from the oil and place on a baking rack  or a plate lined with paper towels to drain.

LuRomisk,Question,5,"I'm supposed to be thawing some pre-made meatballs from a grocery store in some water right now. But I'm having some issues. When I lived alone, I only ever thawed meat in the fridge overnight amd when I was growing up my household would leave things on the counter all day to thaw.

Thawing in the sink isn't totally crazy; I've seen it, but its the items. Being meatballs, the packages have a ton of air.

southerngentleman90,Recipe,11,"Marinara is awesome for bread-dipping and it's very cheap and easy to make. Traditional marinara involves simmering crushed tomatoes with aromatics and seasonings, but my ""cheat"" recipe only requires mixing the ingredients in a bowl, no simmering required. Plus I'm lazy, so it's perfect for me. Taste as you go and adjust the seasoning as you like, or add different ones! Just thin out that tomato paste and throw whatever you want in there. Here's my usual starting point:

Ingredients:

One 6-ounce can of tomato paste

6 ounces of water or broth of choice (I use the can to measure if using water)

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon dry oregano

Pinch of sugar (if desired)

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions:

Empty can of tomato paste into a bowl. Add the water/broth a little bit at a time while stirring until the sauce gets to the desired consistency. Add less for a thicker sauce or more for a thinner sauce.

Mix in spices/aromatics and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.

If possible, let rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge to let the flavors meld together.

Enjoy with whatever you want to dip into it, or use for pizza or pasta sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

I suggest tasting as you go to get the seasoning to your preference. You can always add more seasoning or water, but you can't take it away.

This can be flavored however you like. Basil is a great addition, or cayenne powder if you like a little kick to the sauce. If cooking with a kid, I suggest adding the cayenne yourself for both flavor and safety reasons.

If you like your marinara warm (I do), put it in a microwave-safe bowl and add roughly a teaspoon of water. Microwave on medium strength in 20 second intervals, stirring in between, until it's warm throughout.

If using for pizza, I find it best to have a thinner sauce, so shoot for the upper-end of the water portion.",cookingforbeginners,How to make marinara easily,1604754990,5,319,"How to make marinara easily Marinara is awesome for bread-dipping and it's very cheap and easy to make.

I'm trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but I don't cook very often and when I do I almost exclusively do quick and easy meals. I'm chronically ill so my doctors really want me to eat better but it's tough when standing for more than a few minutes tires me out.

southerngentleman90,Recipe,34,"If you have favorite authentic Mexican spot, you know how much of a difference fresh corn tortillas make when it comes to tacos. Now I won't claim my tortillas are as good as my favorite taqueria, but they are pretty dam close and way better than store-bought. Most recipes will call for a tortilla press or rolling pin, but I'll let you in on a secret: all you need to do is get the tortillas flat and thin and you can accomplish that easily with basically anything you have that's flat. I use my cutting board, but you could use a pan or sturdy plate. Hell, use a flat rock from the yard if you want to. Just get to squishing that wet corn flour.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tools:**

One ziplock bag with the top and sides cut off

One mixing bowl

One cutting board or other flat and sturdy surface (plates, pans, cooking sheets, etc)

One skillet

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

1 Cup Masa Harina (dried corn flour)

1 Cup Water

1 teaspoon Salt

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

Mix together the Masa Harina and salt.

&amp;#x200B;

Form a well in the center of the Masa.

&amp;#x200B;

Add 1/2 of the water and begin mixing by hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly add water until it forms into a firm dough ball that holds its shape. You may find that you need more water or that you may need less depending on your kitchen environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pinch off a roughly golfball-sized piece of the dough and roll it into a ball until smooth.

&amp;#x200B;

Lay out the cut ziplock bag and place the dough ball onto one side. Fold the other half of the bag to cover the dough. 

Optionally, you can lightly dust the bag with flour or spray with a non-stick spray.

&amp;#x200B;

Place the cutting board on top of the covered dough ball and press straight down slowly, using your body weight.

Continue until the tortilla is at your preferred thickness, roughly 1/8 of an inch.

&amp;#x200B;

Carefully peel off the top of the bag. Place one hand underneath the bag and tortilla and flip it onto your other hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Gently peel off the second side the same as the first.

&amp;#x200B;

Place the tortilla on a skillet set to medium high. Cook for about 1 minute and flip, cooking for an additional minute.

&amp;#x200B;

Remove and place on a towel-lined plate. As tortillas are cooked, place them in a stack on the plate and cover with the towel.

Covering with the towel helps the tortillas steam with their residual heat, making them soft and pliable.

Pepelefrogswood,Recipe,8,"I’m 17 and live in the UK. I do enjoy school meals but I want to start taking ownership of my eating as I’m growing into an adult and going to uni, I’ll be becoming more dependant on myself to cook for myself and hopefully others too because it’s something that seems fun to me. 

I can cook some hot meals but I would like to make food I can eat cold in school and enjoy just as much so I thought pasta salads would be a good place to start but I’m a food lover so any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated. 

I’ll state a couple of foods I LOVE so maybe you could suggest some recipes or ingredients that would suit my preferences.
I love:
-Chicken
-BBQ type meals
-sea food
-Coleslaw
-Mayonnaise
-Beef
-Pork
-Fruits &amp; vegetables
-Pasta
-Rice

Basically anything to be fair :)

I do enjoy school meals but I want to start taking ownership of my eating as I’m growing into an adult and going to uni, I’ll be becoming more dependant on myself to cook for myself and hopefully others too because it’s something that seems fun to me. 

I can cook some hot meals but I would like to make food I can eat cold in school and enjoy just as much so I thought pasta salads would be a good place to start but I’m a food lover so any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated. 

I’ll state a couple of foods I LOVE so maybe you could suggest some recipes or ingredients that would suit my preferences.
I love:
-Chicken
-BBQ type meals
-sea food
-Coleslaw
-Mayonnaise
-Beef
-Pork
-Fruits &amp; vegetables
-Pasta
-Rice

Basically anything to be fair :)

Ingredients :
 
Soup 1 

 - 60gr Parsnip
 - 100gr Carrot
 - 320gr Red Bell Pepper
 - 300gr Tomatoes
 - 205gr Onion
 - 6 cloves/20gr Garlic
 - 150ml Veggie Stock/Soup

 - 150gr Parsnip
 - 220gr Celery Root
 - 150gr Red Onion
 - 130gr Yellow Onion
 - 120gr Carrot
 - 500ml Veggie Stock/Soup

Procedure : 

Start by washing and peeling your vegetables. Cut in small cubes/pieces. You want the rooty(hard) vegetables to be smaller than the softer ones (for example tomato, red bell pepper)
because the harder ones will cook harder. Pop them in the oven at 180-200°C for around 20 minutes, for soup 2 around 25-30 minutes. You have to check on them to see when they start getting
that caramelization and they become soft.

Put them into a strong blender and start adding veggie stock. You can replace a part of the veggie stock with cream. I personally don't like it with cream so I made it with veggie stock.
You can use chicken stock if you want that. Adjust the veggie stock/cream little by little until you get the consistence that you like.

unittwentyfive,Question,4,"I found a dozen or so small white worms on the outsides of some tomatoes, and would like to know if it's okay to still eat the 'good' tomatoes from that package.

I bought a box of little multicoloured heirloom tomatoes from the supermarket about 2 days ago. 95% of the tomatoes are fine (firm and nice looking), but there were a few with a bit of black goo and little white worms on them. There was also one that seemed to have been totally desiccated from the inside out. The black goo was probably the guts of the one rotten one that had leaked out and gotten onto the others, as they seemed mostly okay when I rinsed the goo off. 

I sorted the dirty/damaged ones out from the rest and tossed them in the trash. I washed the 'good' ones in soapy water and rinsed them off. Is it okay to eat these? I'm not squeamish just because they were in the same pack as the wormy ones, but I'd rather not eat them if this is an indicator that there may be worms inside the 'good' ones.

I found a dozen or so small white worms on the outsides of some tomatoes, and would like to know if it's okay to still eat the 'good' tomatoes from that package.

I bought a box of little multicoloured heirloom tomatoes from the supermarket about 2 days ago. 95% of the tomatoes are fine (firm and nice looking), but there were a few with a bit of black goo and little white worms on them. There was also one that seemed to have been totally desiccated from the inside out. The black goo was probably the guts of the one rotten one that had leaked out and gotten onto the others, as they seemed mostly okay when I rinsed the goo off. 

I sorted the dirty/damaged ones out from the rest and tossed them in the trash. I washed the 'good' ones in soapy water and rinsed them off. Is it okay to eat these? I'm not squeamish just because they were in the same pack as the wormy ones, but I'd rather not eat them if this is an indicator that there may be worms inside the 'good' ones.

vanizorc,Question,17,"Growing up, our household almost always pan fried meats and vegetables in oil when cooking (and pretty much never used the oven), and to this day it's still the predominant method of cooking that my parents use and insist on. On the occasions where I visit my parents and cook the family dinner, they will always instruct me to pan fry everything. I'd have no issue with this if it weren't for the fact that every time I do, hot oil pretty much flies everywhere, burning my hands, my arms, my face, and especially my eyes. It has made cooking at the family household a pretty traumatic experience for me. Tonight, I reached my breaking point when a bunch of hot oil splattered right into my face and eyes as I was frying some pork belly for my parents. It hurt like hell, but I had to keep frying and there didn't seem to be a way around it. 

The ordeal today made me stop and think that pan frying isn't supposed to be a painful experience (or dangerous, in the case of burning oil flying into my eyes). Is there something other people usually do or use when pan frying, that prevents them from getting burns from the hot oil popping up? It's weird how there's barely any questions/answers regarding this issue online...I'd have thought it was a more common problem. (That said, I'm pretty short, so my head/face is much closer to the pan/stove than most people's.)

I would use a ""splatter guard"", but that wouldn't help because I need to keep the pan uncovered in order to use my spatula to flip/move/stir the food every few seconds (so that the food doesn't stick to the pan or burn on one side and to make sure it's cooked evenly). Splatter guards also won't help with the oil splatters/pops that fly onto me as I'm putting the raw food (meats and veggies) into the pan.

And I can't reduce the amount of oil used either, because my parents want there to be enough oil to  drench and sauté the chopped garlic/onions/ginger/whatever that's added to enhance the flavor and aroma of the food. They also insist that I fry food on a high heat setting, especially for meats, as it reduces the cooking time and gives a better sear.

So aside from the above, what other safety measures could I use when pan frying, in order to reduce the amount of burning oil getting onto my skin and eyes?

These are also my first decorated sweets. I never decorated cupcakes or cakes before, and also my first cupcakes.

Recipe :

Nana's Devil Cupcakes 15-19 cupcakes

 - 2cups of flour
 - 3/4cup cocoa
 - 2cups of sugar
 - 1cup of oil
 - 1cup of milk 
 - 1cup of coffee
 - 1tsp salt
 - 1tsp baking powder
 - 2tsp baking soda
 - 1tsp vanilla essence
 - 2 eggs

Vanilla Cupcakes around 15-18 cupcakes

 - 2 1/2cups flour
 - 2cups of sugar
 - 3tsp baking powder
 - 1tsp salt
 - 2cups milk
 - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
 - 1tbsp vanilla essence
 - 2 eggs

Strawberry Sauce 
 - 400gr strawberry (frozen)
 - 100-150gr sugar
Bring to a boil and then use a blender when strawberries are very soft.

This gonna be long. For Nana's Devil Cupcakes

In a bowl you put the flour with cocoa, salt, baking powder, soda. In another bowl you mix the eggs with the sugar, milk, coffee, oil and vanilla essence.
You put the dry ingredients in the wet ones. All at once. The recipe says to gently fold with a wooden spoon and not overmix. You will end up having lumps. 
I personally started to use a whisk because I had really big lumps, but I still didn't overmix and remained with some lumps. 
The end result was still great.

Fill 2/3 of your cupcake paper, and bake it at 190 degree Celsius for 20-25 minutes. They're done when you put a toothpick in them and it comes out clean.

-------------------------

Now for Vanilla Cupcakes

In a bowl you put the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and mix it a little. In another bowl, you get milk, vegetable oil, vanilla essence, and eggs and combine of course.
Now you add the wet ingredients to the dry ones and here, you can mix with a whisk as much as you want. Get rid of lumps.

Fill 2/3 of your cupcake paper, bake it at 175 degree Celsius for 35 minutes or until you do the toothpick test.

Both of these are cooked with no fan. When you pull them out of the oven, let them stay in the baking tray and paper for 5-10 minutes. Don't get them out of the paper until they're room temp.

----------------------------

So Nana's Devil Cake/Cupcake. I did not really liked them, but that's mostly because I personally don't really enjoy cocoa sweets. 
Don't try to combine both batters into one. I did it, but I did not mix them, maybe if you mix them it will work better, but then you gonna lose all the vanilla if you mix it.",cookingforbeginners,My first take at Halloween Cupcakes,1603909745,6,449,"My first take at Halloween Cupcakes Hey!

southerngentleman90,Recipe,13,"If you like miso soup from the Japanese restaurant, you owe it to yourself to find some miso paste.

**What is Miso Paste?**

Miso paste is made from fermented soybeans and a (healthy) bacteria culture. There are three main types of miso: Shiro, Awase, and Aki. Each is fermented longer than the last. As a result, Shiro miso will be milder and sweeter in flavor, while Aki miso will be stronger and saltier due to the longer fermentation. That leaves Awase in the middle.

**Are there health benefits?**

A ton. I'll [leave it to the experts](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-miso-is-healthy) to explain all of them. The quick answer is that it is full of nutrients that are difficult to obtain in other foods. Also, due to the fermentation process, it's chock-full of probiotics. So much like yogurt, it promotes good digestion. Anytime I feel sick or run down, I've always craved miso soup, but for a long time didn't know why it felt so healing besides just tasting comforting. Turns out it's because it's super good for you. The main drawback is that it is high in sodium, so moderation is key if you are watching that.

**How do I use it?**

Miso soup comes to mind, and while it is awesome and super easy to make (it's dashi stock and miso paste heated up), it doesn't stop there. Miso is fantastic as a marinade, can be mixed with softened butter (I used it in my eggs this morning instead of salt, used in ramen, and I'm sure much more that hopefully we can learn in the comments.

**How to make Miso Soup:**

Basic miso soup is simply dashi stock and miso paste, plus whatever other add-ins you like. Dashi stock is a soup stock, most commonly made using kelp and bonito flakes (dried fish flakes). There are other variations as well using ingredients such as mushrooms. I like to make my own dashi sometimes, but more often than not I just use [Hondashi](https://www.amazon.com/Ajinomoto-Stock-Hondashi-Original-Version/dp/B0000CNU0C?th=1), which is basically bullion for dashi stock. It's cheap and one little jar makes a ton of stock. So buckle in, this one's a real doozy.

**Ingredients:**

1 cup water

1 teaspoon Hondashi

1 tablespoon miso paste

**Instructions**

Bring water to a boil and mix in Hondashi until fully combined.

Move off of the heat and whisk in miso paste. Many people like to whisk the miso paste into a bit of water in a separate bowl to help it incorporate into the stock.

Add whatever you like or enjoy it as a delicious brothy umami soup all by itself!

**Notes**

This makes a single serving, which I find handy since it's so simple to make. As you can imagine it's very easy to scale up to suit how much you need.

My typical extras are green onions, white or yellow onions, mushrooms of all kinds, and whatever veggies I have on hand that I need to use up. Other options include noodles, rice, seafood, etc. Basically whatever you want to add!

Smaller supermarkets may or may not have miso paste and hondashi, but most decent sized ones should. If you have a local Asian market I'd recommend going there.",cookingforbeginners,Ingredient Spotlight: Miso Past + how to easily make Miso Soup,1603890624,11,510,"Ingredient Spotlight: Miso Past + how to easily make Miso Soup If you like miso soup from the Japanese restaurant, you owe it to yourself to find some miso paste.

I do not have a pan large enough to hold the steak, but i do have a large pot, like one you would use to hold pasta, gumbo, soup, etc. i was wondering if searing the steak in a pot, where the only real difference is the tall outer edges, would ruin the sear compared to a pan. The undersized pan is unusable because there is no even sear, a lot of splattering, and its overall not great. So can I use a pot?"

zippopwnage,Recipe,4,"Hey! So this week I finally made Pumpkin Bread. Never had it before so it was a first time for me in taste and into the process of making it.
I think I did a pretty good job, at least I'm happy with the end result. 

Here it is : https://imgur.com/gallery/v6h6Axe

And of course, recipe : 

Ingredients : 

 - 125gr flour                        
 - 200gr sugar
 - 1 egg
 - 85gr butte
 - 1/2tsp baking soda            
 - 1/4tsp baking powder   
 - 16gr vanilla sugar    
 - 210gr pumpkin puree    

Procedure 

 - Mix in a bowl flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and spices. Combine the butter and sugar in a large bowl. Use a mixer and beat until combined/crumbly.
 - Add your egg and some vanilla essence and continue to mix. You can add the pumpkin puree, mix again until combines, and add your dry ingredients. 
 - You want to fold it together with a wooden spoon, but don’t overmix. Mix until you won’t see any flower left.
 - Transfer it to a loaf pan with a baking paper on it and cook it at 165-170°C for 1 hour. 
 - Check it with a toothpick. It should come clean after you poke it.

This recipe will get you 1 ""loaf"" of pumpkin bread. I didn't know if this will work or if is good, so I wanted to be safe.

I hope this is as friendly as possible. I'm trying to get better at these things, and I want to help others into trying my recipes.

MistaCheez,Question,8,"I have to be the dumbest person alive.

 My parents never cooked when I was growing up, and I don't really like ""cooking"" per se, but I do need to eat to survive so here I am. One of my preferred meals to make is scrambled eggs for their price and protein value, however I have struggled against cooking them literally my entire life. When I was a child I would make them using a non-stick pan and Pam, but I never had any idea what temperature to heat the pan to or when to put the Pam in or anything of the sort. So some nights I basically didn't eat. I still, at age 24, have absolutely no idea what I am doing and over my life they are my most cooked meal bar none. Recently I have been using butter instead of Pam, as I had run out, but seeing as I am clueless about cooking I have had the eggs stick to the **nonstick** pan every single time so far. Butter early, butter late, very hot pan, cold pan, everywhere in between, I cook eggs like 3 times a week and they never turn out right (or if they do it is a miracle and I cannot recreate it).

How To Make Milk Foam 3 Ways Step By Step WITHOUT An Espresso Machine

You will need:

Milk (Preferably Full Cream Milk)

A Jar, French Press or Frothing Wand

Steps:

To Make Milk Foam with a Jar:

1)  Grab a decently sized jar and fill it with milk. Make sure you don’t fill more than half the jar with milk as you will need some space in the jar to make the foam.

2)  Seal the jar tightly and shake it up and down for 30 to 60 seconds.

3)  Once done, remove the jar lid and place the jar in a microwave. If your jar is not microwave safe, pour the milk into a microwave safe cup or bowl.

4)  Heat the milk in 10 second intervals till you reach your desired temperature.

5)  Your milk foam is now ready to be served with your coffee or tea.

To Make Milk Foam with a French Press:

1)  Grab a French press and fill it with milk. Make sure you don’t fill more than half the French press with milk as you will need some space in the jar to make the foam.

2)  Cover the French press with the plunger and start pumping the milk slowly until you develop a nice layer of foam in the French press.

3)  Once done, transfer the milk into a microwave safe cup or bowl (if necessary).

4)  Heat the milk in 10 second intervals till you reach your desired temperature.

5)  Your milk foam is now ready to be served with your coffee or tea.

To Make Milk Foam with a Frothing Wand:

1)  Grab a decently sized jar or cup and fill it with milk. Make sure you don’t fill more than half the jar with milk as you will need some space in the jar or cup to make the foam.

2)  Dip half of the tip of your frothing wand into the surface of the milk. Turn on the frothing wand and let the wand churn the surface milk for 30 to 60 seconds. Thereafter, dip the hand of the frothing wand into the milk and let it churn the milk for another 10 to 20 seconds. 

3)  Once done, transfer the milk into a microwave safe cup or bowl (if necessary).

4)  Heat the milk in 10 second intervals till you reach your desired temperature.

southerngentleman90,Recipe,38,"Emulsification. I can barely even say it. You've probably heard it said a lot on cooking shows. So to get it out of the way, Wikipedia defines an emulsion thusly: "" An **emulsion** is a [mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture) of two or more [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid) that are normally [immiscible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immiscible) (unmixable or unblendable) owing to liquid-liquid [phase separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_separation). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) called [colloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid). ""

That's a fancy-pants way to say it but you guys know I like to be super-scientific. To put it simply, to emulsify something is to mix together two things that don't like each other, like oil and water. Add the word to your daily vocabulary so you can feel superior when you force it into conversation and people only vaguely know what it means, likely from context clues.

**How does this apply to cooking?**

Emulsification comes into play a lot with food. Probably the most visual example is a vinaigrette, which at it's core is an oil and vinegar (or often other acidic liquid) mixture. You can easily make your own vinaigrette by mixing oil and vinegar (or citrus juice, etc) together and giving it a good shake. When you shake it enough, the oil and vinegar will emulsify from the physical action. For a bit you will have a tasty homogenous vinaigrette, but over time the oil and vinegar will begin to separate again. For a freshly made vinaigrette that's not a big deal since you can just shake it again, but what if you want to keep a mixture emulsified for longer? That's why we need:

**MORE INTIMIDATING SCIENCE WORDS!**

To make the water and oil stay friends for longer, we need to introduce a chemical of some sort into the equation. Think adding booze to a party so the people are more open to mingling. There are many chemicals used to aid in the emulsification process, and chances are you consume them every day. A few common ones are *lecithin*, *sodium phosphate*, and *diglycerides*. I'm sorry if that gave you a spook, but I did warn you about more science.

Let's go ahead and take the venom out of those words. Lecithin is found in egg yolks. Sodium Phosphate is prevalent in processed cheese like Velveeta or American cheese slices. Diglycerides (and other 'glycerides) are found in things like coffee creamer or some baked goods. To really mix it up, detergents like dish soap are surfactants, a type of emulsifier. They bind the oil and water together so you can clean it up with a cloth, or more water. We use emulsifiers and stabilizing chemicals all of the time without even realizing it!

**You haven't even talked about the cheese sauce!**

Oh yeah! If you've made cheese sauce at home before, you've probably noticed that melted cheese wants to return to it's solid form as it cools off. The heat and stirring helped it to emulsify, but it's not stable. Some cheeses don't even want to emulsify in the first place and are nearly impossible to make a melty sauce with. Or are they?

J. Kenji Lopez-Alt has [A great write-up](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html) on how to make a nacho cheese sauce using cornstarch and evaporated milk that inspired me to learn more about the process. I'm about to get all mad scientist for a second but hear me out.

I don't typically have evaporated milk on hand but I wanted creamy cheese sauce. I researched and found that the reason this works is that evaporated milk typically contains both an emulsifying agent and a stabilizing agent. It contains sodium phosphate, for example. You know what else contains a lot of emulsifiers and stabilizers? **American Cheese**. Also known as processed cheese product, these melty slices of ""cheese"" are actually only about half cheese. The other half is added things to make it melt easy and stay melted, like sodium phosphate! As a result, it has an extremely mild flavor and is full of emulsifiers.

So what about the cornstarch? It's the thickening agent that keeps the sauce from getting too liquidy. If you have a bag of pre-shredded cheese, look at the ingredients and find that you already have cornstarch. It's typically added to the cheese to keep it from clumping up while it sits in the bag. Of course if you're melting a block cheese you'll want to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the mixture, but I'm all about efficiency.

# Let's make melted cheese!

This can be used to make a silky cheese sauce (that stays melty for a while) with a few ingredients you probably already have. And since I've also melted our brains with science, I'll keep it dead simple. Note that the American cheese will not add much flavor, if any. For example, if you make a gouda sauce, it will taste primarily of gouda while being melty like American cheese.

**Ingredients**

SOME SHREDDED CHEESE

A SLICE OF AMERICAN CHEESE

SOME MILK

MAYBE SOME BUTTER

FLAVOR STUFF IF YOU WANT

**Instructions**

If using butter (I do), slowly melt it over medium low heat. It's important to keep the heat fairly low.

Stir in a bit of milk, enough to submerge the amount of cheese you chose. Heat for a minute or two.

Add in shredded cheese. Only you know how much cheese sauce you'll want, but a standard size bag is a safe bet. You can save it and reheat it later, so don't be shy.

Stir for a couple of minutes as the cheese melts to the desired consistency.

Add in a slice of American Cheese. Melt for a minute or two while stirring it into the mixture.

Once everything is nice and combined and the consistency is where you want it, serve hot with literally anything. I could eat cheese sauce with a spoon.

**Notes**

I know this was a long read that lead up to a vague recipe, but I find that understanding the basic science behind ingredients, interactions, and methods makes cooking more fun. It allows us to go off of the beaten path, so to speak.

This works with most cheeses as far as I know. Kenji's method works a bit better, but I don't keep evaporated milk around and a lot of household's always have american cheese, so I feel my off-brand method is worth sharing.

Our emulsion, while nice and longer lasting than a standard melted cheese, still won't last forever. Once this sauce spends some time at room temp or in the fridge, it will slowly start to thicken. The good news is that it heats up very well!

I roasted a chicken this week and we ate about 70% of the meat. I stored the cooled cooked carcass+full legs in the fridge for a couple of days.

I want actual pieces of chicken in the soup (that I will separate from the drained stock) so that it will be a bit chunky.

southerngentleman90,Recipe,43,"In fact, all you really need to make a basic flatbread is flour, water, and salt. Even the salt isn't necessary really. Hell, you don't even need a bowl or a spoon. You can make a pile of flour on your counter (cleaned counter I hope), make a little well in the center, and slowly mix in water with your hands until it forms a dough. Then squish it and toss it on a hot surface and you've got a basic flatbread that could be made on a rock in the woods with no tools other than the means to make fire.

Now that we've gone to the extreme end of simplification and removed the mystery of making probably the world's oldest bread product, I'll go into a leavened version that is only a tiny bit more complex, but will yield fluffy, chewy flatbreads with those characteristic air pockets.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: These amounts are mostly a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Think of it as a starting point, in no time you won't even need to get near a measuring cup to make it.

**Ingredients**

2 cups all-purpose flour 

1 1/2-2 teaspoons baking powder

A pinch of salt

3/4 cup of water

1 tablespoon of oil

**Instructions**

If you want to get fancy, use a bowl. For the record though, you can absolutely make this using the pile of flour method if you want. That counter's gonna get flour on it anyway so why not.

Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. If you'd like to flavor it up with other seasonings (garlic powder for example) add it now.

Add the water a small amount at a time and begin mixing together by hand, or with a spoon, or a stick or something.

Once a rough dough begins to form, add the olive oil and mix by hand until a cohesive ball has formed. Add flour/liquid if needed during this process. We want dough that is pliable, but not too sticky.

Dust the counter (for the love of god make sure it's clean first) with flour and plop that dough boy on there. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it slowly springs back when you poke it.

Now we will portion it into balls somewhere between golf ball and baseball sized. A bench scraper is ideal for this, but I use an old, dull knife to separate into chunks. 

Make the dough flat. My favorite way to do this is by gently pressing it out with my fingertips until it is about 1/4 inch thick, occasionally picking it up by the edges to stretch it out. I find that by hand-working the dough, we preserve more of the gluten structure formed from the kneading process. You can also roll it out with a rolling pin, can of beans, beer bottle, whatever. It'll still be very good, just make sure it's flat.

Heat a skillet to medium-high, using a bit of cooking spray if you feel it may get sticky (totally optional). Slap a flat-dough on there and watch it bubble up for a minute or two. Once the underside has gotten nice and browned and it's puffed up a bit, gently flip and cook for another minute or two, until the bubbles on the bottom have browned up. After flipping I like to mush it down very gently with the spatula to slightly even out the browning, but honestly I mostly do that cause it's fun.

As flatbreads finish cooking, place them in a stack on a plate and cover them with a towel. The residual heat will slightly steam them, making them soft and pliable.

Enjoy with wraps, curry, or topped with softened butter.",cookingforbeginners,"Flatbread doesn't have to be complicated, and you probably have what you need to make it.",1603374286,16,601,"Flatbread doesn't have to be complicated, and you probably have what you need to make it.

tvgirl48,Question,14,"It sounds simple - take frozen chicken out of freezer and stick it in the fridge 24 hours ahead of cooking. But this has been my experience:

1. Move chicken breasts from freezer to fridge, 24 hours later take them out, they're still half frozen. Stick in the oven and  cook anyway for longer, it works out okay, although the extra cooking time to get the centers done overcooks the outside a little. Still edible.

AviateX14,Question,8,"I enjoy cooking - the actual act of cooking - but what I find unbelievably challenging is meal planning and shopping for ingredients. Browsing through cookbooks or recipes online I see lots of meals I’d *like* to have a go at making, but often find that (for a contrived example) one meal requires 3 carrots, but I can only buy them in bags of 5, and none of the other meals I can see need carrots - rinse and repeat with a significant number of ingredients per recipe. 

This rubs me up the wrong way because I feel like I should be able to buy ingredients that I can use across multiple different meals and recipes.

This is the one BIG draw to services like HelloFresh, that they take care of the ingredient planning.

Doubt-Grouchy,Question,6,"Hi everyone, I've been cooking for roughly 4-5 weeks and am happy to have finally begun this undertaking. So far I've focused on Latin American and Asian dishes that have looked mostly low maintenance while also offering a degree of flexibility. Things I've made include vegetarian ""butter chicken"", pad thai, eggplant with garlic sauce, vegetarian chilorio, and enchiladas.

I've been very interested in Peruvian cuisine for a while, my cousins who live in the next state are half Peruvian and I have memories of my aunt making arroz verde and chicken skewers that were spectacular when I was younger. I've done my research and it seems like the one fundamental ingredient that can be hard to locate is yellow aji paste, I've visited local hispanic groceries and checked the hispanic section of the supermarkets in my town, and each seem to lack it. I'm willing to order it online if need be, and on top of that it's possible in one of the cities adjacent to mine that one of the much bigger supermarkets will have it.

Does anybody have any experience with this cuisine specifically? Every recipe I've made this far has offered some type of lesson in terms of proper preparation and which ingredients are fundamental and can't be skipped lol. I'll say the two dishes I made that were madly disappointing were eggplant with garlic sauce because I didn't add spicy bean paste so the resultant flavor had no salt, and the vegetarian chilorio because I burnt the chilies so they were too bitter and because I used dried whole mushrooms in place of pork and the mushrooms didn't even absorb the sauce well probably bc the recipe called for sliced mushrooms lol. What I'm looking for are tips in terms of what ingredients and steps can't be skipped so that I know what to ensure I have in order to not sink the whole thing if I mess something up.

BushyEyes,Recipe,2,"Okay, I love brothy beans. They're so easy to make and you can serve them with literally anything. You can start with a base of your favorite aromatics, add vegetables as you like, broth, and then beans. Serve it with crusty bread, a fried egg, or a protein of choice, such as fish, shrimp, or even a fried pork chop or chicken thigh. Below are my two all-time favorite brothy bean recipes. 

But first, I'll give you the anatomy of the brothy beans so you can customize them to your taste;

**Aromatics (Pick one or two):**

* Leeks
* Scallions
* Garlic and/or Shallot (add garlic last; be careful not to burn it)
* Vidalia onion; great if you can caramelize it a bit
* Plain old yellow cooking onion
* Finely chopped celery
* Ginger, if you're going for more of an Asian-infused flavor

**Vegetables (Pick up to 3...don't overpower the broth!):**

* Quartered tomatoes
* Kale, spinach, baby bok choy, or arugula (add at the very end)
* Sugar snap peas
* Quartered baby potatoes (add with the beans and cook until fork tender)
* Slices of prepared roasted red bell peppers

**Broth (Pick 1)**

* Prepared chicken or vegetable stock. For 1 can of beans, use 2-3 cups of stock. For 2 cans of beans, use 4-5 cups stock. You don't want the broth to overwhelm the beans.
* If you're trying to go for more Asian flavors, try this out with a Dashi broth 
* If you have no stock, fear not, just use water but amp up the flavor with spices

**Beans (Pick 1-2...I prefer using one variety of bean but you can mix it up!)**

* Cannellini
* Navy beans
* Great Northern Beans
* Garbanzo Beans
* Corona Beans if u like **Thicc Bois**
* Typically this recipe works best with creamy white beans that absorb the flavor!

**Spices:**

* Depending on what you're going for, I stick with my trifecta: dry thyme, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper and maybe fresh or dry parsley. You can get creative depending on what flavor profile you're going for, but that's what I like.

If you don't have white miso, you can also use 2 anchovies and mash them into the skillet before adding the stock or you can even make this broth with capers. It won't be the same as the white miso but it'll still be delicious. You can also use tahini - just add it to the stock and stir until it dissolves.

They're so easy to make and you can serve them with literally anything. You can start with a base of your favorite aromatics, add vegetables as you like, broth, and then beans. Serve it with crusty bread, a fried egg, or a protein of choice, such as fish, shrimp, or even a fried pork chop or chicken thigh. Below are my two all-time favorite brothy bean recipes. 

But first, I'll give you the anatomy of the brothy beans so you can customize them to your taste;

**Aromatics (Pick one or two):**

* Leeks
* Scallions
* Garlic and/or Shallot (add garlic last; be careful not to burn it)
* Vidalia onion; great if you can caramelize it a bit
* Plain old yellow cooking onion
* Finely chopped celery
* Ginger, if you're going for more of an Asian-infused flavor

**Vegetables (Pick up to 3...don't overpower the broth!):**

* Quartered tomatoes
* Kale, spinach, baby bok choy, or arugula (add at the very end)
* Sugar snap peas
* Quartered baby potatoes (add with the beans and cook until fork tender)
* Slices of prepared roasted red bell peppers

**Broth (Pick 1)**

* Prepared chicken or vegetable stock. For 1 can of beans, use 2-3 cups of stock. For 2 cans of beans, use 4-5 cups stock. You don't want the broth to overwhelm the beans.
* If you're trying to go for more Asian flavors, try this out with a Dashi broth 
* If you have no stock, fear not, just use water but amp up the flavor with spices

**Beans (Pick 1-2...I prefer using one variety of bean but you can mix it up!)**

* Cannellini
* Navy beans
* Great Northern Beans
* Garbanzo Beans
* Corona Beans if u like **Thicc Bois**
* Typically this recipe works best with creamy white beans that absorb the flavor!

**Spices:**

* Depending on what you're going for, I stick with my trifecta: dry thyme, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper and maybe fresh or dry parsley. You can get creative depending on what flavor profile you're going for, but that's what I like.

If you'd like to see some pictures : https://imgur.com/gallery/ZrDBwS2

If you don't make the pie crust at home, this is a very easy recipe, and anyone can make it.
I personally chose to not make my pie crust because after researching a little, it takes a lot of time, and the one from the store is good enough.

So Recipe (You can make 1 whole big pie or 15-20 Smaller ones like mine)

 - 750gr Pumpkin Puree
 - 140gr Sugar
 - 10-15gr Vanilla Sugar
 - 175ml Milk
 - 2 Eggs
 - 25gr Butter
 - 1tsp Cinnamon
 - 1/2tsp Salt
 - 1/2tsp Nutmeg(or a little less since nutmeg is really strong)

Now to make the pumpkin puree...that's easy. Cut your pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, brush it with a little vegetable oil, and cook it in the oven at 170 degree Celsius until your fork can go VERY easy trough them.

 - Now scoop out the puree from the pumpkin, mash it a little and when it gets to room temperature you can start making your filling.
 - Add the eggs to the pumpkin puree and mix until everything combines nicely.
 - Add the butter. Recommended here is melted butter, but I personally used one that was in shape but warm enough that it melts when you mix it with the filling. I got a great result. The point is to mix everything until you won't see the butter anymore if you want to do it like me.
 - Add the sugar, milk, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. And mix until everything looks nice.

And now how to prepare the rest:

 - Prepare your pie crust to not be super cold when you try to put it in the tart shapes, but it should be cold before putting it into the oven. Use non-stick spray or butter to coat your pie forms.
 - You have to precook the pie crust. Make some holes in the bottom with a fork after you put them in the shape and put some weight on them with a baking paper (Beans, Stones, Rice) and cook them at 170-180 degree Celsius until you spot the first color change. At this point you want them to cook JUST ENOUGH for the base to not get fluffy. This steps take like 5-10 minutes.
 - Now remove the weight from them and cook them like 5-8 more minutes so you won't have a moist base. You want it to be crispy! It should be done when the base is starting to get color. Don't make them golden brown all the way, because there's a chance to burn them when you cook the pumpkin.
 - Add the filling to your pie crust or mini pie crusts, and cook them for another 15-20 minutes at 170 degree celsius, or until you see the crust having a great golden brown color. You don't want to burn the crust.
 - Now add whip cream and decorate them as you want...and Enjoy them! 

My SO made some little shapes with the remaining pie crust that we had. Some small pumpkins leaves and mushrooms. I don't know to tell you how to make them because I have no talent into shaping them. But, if you want to do it, all I know is that you need the pie crust to be cold when you shape them, and cold when you cook it.

I was SUPER HAPPY with the end result, even though I had a weird tube of whip cream and the blob of whip cream was a little weird. Now, I would love to hear if any of you have different secrets or ingredients that goes into this kind of pie?
What spices do use other than cinnamon or nutmeg ?

 - Now remove the weight from them and cook them like 5-8 more minutes so you won't have a moist base. You want it to be crispy! It should be done when the base is starting to get color. Don't make them golden brown all the way, because there's a chance to burn them when you cook the pumpkin.
 - Add the filling to your pie crust or mini pie crusts, and cook them for another 15-20 minutes at 170 degree celsius, or until you see the crust having a great golden brown color. You don't want to burn the crust.
 - Now add whip cream and decorate them as you want...and Enjoy them! 

My SO made some little shapes with the remaining pie crust that we had. Some small pumpkins leaves and mushrooms. I don't know to tell you how to make them because I have no talent into shaping them. But, if you want to do it, all I know is that you need the pie crust to be cold when you shape them, and cold when you cook it.

I was SUPER HAPPY with the end result, even though I had a weird tube of whip cream and the blob of whip cream was a little weird. Now, I would love to hear if any of you have different secrets or ingredients that goes into this kind of pie?
What spices do use other than cinnamon or nutmeg ? 

Also, tips or a good recipe for home made pie crust?"

Alaharon123,Recipe,3,"Some information on me that should inform how you read this post:

* My cooking skills fall somewhere between beginner and intermediate. I've made recipes before and the basic eggs and stuff without a recipe and feel confident in my ability to follow a given recipe, but this is the first time I've been cooking ~90% of my meals
* I do not like beans
* Other than the bad chili they served occasionally for two years in my high school, I never had tex-mex before
* I like chicken
* I made some substitutions and am judging based on them and will say by each recipe what they were
* I am ranking mostly based on taste, not price or health or anything else

And so, the ranking from most favorite to least favorite

**S Tier**:

1) [Garlic Noodles with Beef and Broccoli](https://www.budgetbytes.com/garlic-noodles-with-beef-and-broccoli/)

I replaced the oyster sauce with half hoisin sauce and half soy sauce. I really don't have much to say about this. It's just really fucking good. The flavors all come together really well and the crushed red pepper adds a nice spice that gives the whole thing the perfect bit of heat. I think the only thing I want to do different next time, other than maybe obtaining oyster sauce, is cracking the spaghetti in half to make it easier to apportion. [Picture of how mine came out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676978543640444928/767184472075403304/P_20201017_203444_1.jpg)

2) [Turkey Taco Skillet](https://www.budgetbytes.com/turkey-taco-skillet/)

I made this with ground beef instead of ground turkey and did not include the scallions/green onions. I don't really know the difference between the taco option and the quesadilla option, I think I did something in between. This is the one I just made so I haven't yet reheated the leftovers and eaten more than one portion. Regardless, who kept quesadillas/soft tacos from me all my life? idk if it's just this one or if they're generally amazing, but holy crap, it's really good, highly recommend it. Might edit in a picture if I can get a clean quesadilla out of the leftovers (didn't flip right the first time since it was my first time ever trying it)

3) [Skillet Cheeseburger Pasta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/skillet-cheeseburger-pasta/)

Like mac and cheese with some burger in it and a kickass sauce. Note that when Budget Bytes refers to ounces of cheese, they're referring to weight, not fluid. I figured that out from... somewhere, I don't remember. The pictures on the site don't do it justice for how cheesy it is, but it *is* supposed to be that cheesy and it's really good. The recipe mentions how the hot dog relish really gives it that burger taste and I very much agree. I doubt I'll use it for anything else, but I made two batches of this recipe and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

**A Tier**:

4) [Sweet Chili Chicken Stir Fry Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/sweet-chili-chicken-stir-fry-bowls/)

Used light coconut milk instead of regular, as suggested in the standalone savory coconut rice recipe, used the teriyaki sauce recipe rather than sweet chili sauce since I had all the ingredients for it already, and used a percentage of a larger can of pineapple chunks rather than an 8oz can of pineapple tidbits because stores near me did not have the latter. The star of this show was the coconut rice tbh. I don't usually like coconut because of its texture, but the coconut flavor along with the jasmine rice and the garlic all came together to make some really good-tasting rice. Especially since I used a rice cooker so I didn't need much water besides from the can of coconut milk. tbh this recipe doesn't really do the rice justice because the teriyaki mixture overpowers the subtle flavor of the rice. Maybe the sweet chili blends in better idk. Regardless, every component of this recipe tastes good. Only thing I'd change is that the recipe should call for an amount of broccoli that you can divide in four to make the same four portions that the chicken makes. Considering that frozen broccoli is sold in 12oz packages, not 16oz, I say just buy two packages and make them both at once and split in four for 6oz/portion rather than 5.3oz with none left for the fourth portion. [Picture of how mine came out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676978543640444928/765037168984064010/P_20201011_222347.jpg)

5) [One Pot Teriyaki Chicken and Rice](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-teriyaki-chicken-and-rice/)

This tasted very similar to the above since I'd replaced the sweet chili in the above with teriyaki anyway. I think I liked the above recipe slightly more because I prefer the broccoli in that recipe over the mixed peppers I bought for this one's frozen stir fry vegetables. Also the coconut rice. It's mostly a matter of which process you prefer I suppose and then customize your preferred process to suit your palette 

6) [Simple Homemade Chili](https://www.budgetbytes.com/basic-chili/)

I like this one chili recipe unlike the other one because it tells you how to customize it. Also because it tastes good. The customization options I used were using two pounds of beef rather than including beans, using Guinness beer instead of water (side note, not a big beer person, but I drank the leftover beer and I prefer Blue Moon and Miller Genuine Draft), and adding a teaspoon of smoked paprika, a cup of frozen corn kernels, some shredded cheese, scallions, and crushed tortilla chips. I really liked the chili a lot, but ngl by the sixth serving I was ready for something else. As a single man living alone, I'd definitely prefer if this recipe made four servings rather than six.

7) [Poor Man's Burrito Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/poor-mans-burrito-bowls/)

I should probably make this again now that I've made more things, this is only the second thing I made, but I was really surprised by how much I liked it considering I don't generally like beans. The Turkey Taco Skillet also has black beans in it though and I like that too, so I might just only like black beans idk. Some recommendations for making this: Use a mild salsa, not medium. I used medium tostitos salsa and it was a little too strong for me. Also, slice your jalapeno as thin as you can and don't refrigerate it. It's very easy to have the jalapeno flavor be too strong. Other than that, go ham on it, it's a surprisingly good recipe.

8) [No-Knead Focaccia Rolls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/focaccia-rolls/)

This would be ranked higher if the recipe were better made. They taste very good. Some tips: the rolls are never going to look like they do in the pictures, idk what filter they used on their camera or how their oven was miscalibrated or whatever. I used an oven thermometer to make sure my oven uses the right temperature and in waiting for it to get as golden on top as in the pictures, the bottom burned and the rolls were hard. They still tasted good after reheating them in the microwave on a damp paper towel since that softened them, but I recommend making them how I did the second time, only waiting a couple minutes longer than the 25 minutes the website says. They won't really look right, but they taste amazing, especially dipped in soup or olive oil. Some recommendations from the comments: If you want whole wheat, use one cup out of four rather than the usual two. Be super liberal with the flour. Use pinch and tuck rather than just rolling into balls. Use parchment paper rather than aluminum foil with cooking spray.

**B Tier**:

9) [Skillet Pineapple BBQ Chicken](https://www.budgetbytes.com/skillet-pineapple-bbq-chicken/)

I used a nonstick skillet and a shitty bbq sauce (Open Pitt) and couldn't get it right. It still tasted pretty good because chicken, but if you're gonna make this, I recommend using a thicker bbq sauce and a stainless steel skillet or other type that's meant for making pan sauces, not nonstick. The pictures make it look super appetizing, but idk. I'll try it again when I buy a nonstick pan I suppose, it *is* chicken after all.

10) [Weeknight Pasta Sauce with Spaghetti](https://www.budgetbytes.com/the-best-weeknight-pasta-sauce/) (using title from meal plan)

Not sure what the author loves about the sauce so much. This to me was very standard spaghetti in sauce with a very small amount of ground beef that really didn't do much to bring it up a notch or anything. Not bad in the slightest, but nothing special.

**C Tier**:

11) [Curried Red Lentil and Pumpkin Soup](https://www.budgetbytes.com/curried-red-lentil-and-pumpkin-soup/)

You have no idea the hell I went through to get pumpkin puree for this recipe. No store near me had it for some reason. Anyway, this was a fairly decent soup, nice flavor, nothing special, good to dip those rolls in. C Tier because fuck pumpkin puree and how hard it was to find.

12) [One Pot Chili Pasta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/snap-challenge-one-pot-chili-pasta/)

This one was ok, but I don't like beans and it makes 9 servings so by the time I finished it, I was pretty sick of beans. If I were to make it again, I'd swap out the beans for more ground beef. Would probably taste good then tbh. I like the corn in this recipe.

13) [Easy Rosemary Garlic White Bean Soup](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-rosemary-garlic-white-bean-soup/)

Lots of beans, not really a fan, but I put in a lot of pepper which was great and of course it was good soup for dipping those rolls into. 

14) [Easy Cauliflower and Chickpea Masala](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-cauliflower-and-chickpea-masala/) 

I feel bad putting this last because I actually really liked the cauliflower and masala part, but there's a reason another name for chickpeas is garbanzo beans. They have the texture of beans. Not a fan.

**Didn't Try**:

[Slow Cooker White Chicken Chili](https://www.budgetbytes.com/slow-cooker-white-chicken-chili/)

This is the second to last recipe in the meal plan and at this point I am all beaned out and I just don't have it in me to make another 6 servings of a bean dish I know I won't like so I'm not bothering

**Conclusion**:

All in all I had a pretty good time making and eating this food over the course of a month and a half or so. I really wish I liked beans because Budget Bytes uses them a lot and they're like, cheap and nutritious or something, but I've now tried beans in multiple dishes and I think I can say with certainty that I do not. I *would* recommend checking out this meal plan if you're like me and don't want to have to choose what to make every day. Some tips on using it: Do use the grocery list at the starting to know if you should buy something in bulk or just a small amount. Do look at the actual web page for each recipe so you can find tips and substitutions and comments rather than just the recipe. Do look at this post and the couple of tips I've scattered throughout.

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Colander

# Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and diced
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced (or use crushed red pepper to taste)
* 1 cup roasted red bell peppers diced
* 14.5 ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes
* 14.5 ounce can whole-peeled tomatoes
* 2 sprigs of basil
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 1/4 cup heavy cream &gt; or omit
* 16 ounces dry pasta of your choice
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Parsley dry or fresh, optional for serving

# Instructions

Start the Sauce:

* Melt the butter into a wide pot over medium heat. Once frothy, add the onion and cook for 7-8 minutes until softened and beginning to brown.
* Add the garlic, minced red pepper, and roasted red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the crushed tomatoes and whole peeled tomatoes and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the sauce begins to bubble, turn the heat to low. Add the basil sprigs and sugar, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have melted. Add water, as necessary, to loosen up the sauce if it sticks.

Cook the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

Finish the Sauce:

* Add the cream and pasta cooking water to the sauce and turn the heat to medium. Once it begins to bubble and thicken, about 5 minutes, turn off the heat and add the cooked pasta and toss to coat it with the sauce. Taste and season again to your preferences.

To Serve:

* Divide the cooked pasta between bowls and garnish with parsley. Enjoy!

HomoCarnula,Recipe,9,"This one is for the beginners :) it makes a tasty treat, you can store meatballs in the fridge and just eat them as a snack, for picknicks or you can build a whole meal around it. Also good for when you don't feel in the mood for cooking, because most of it is waiting. I know it's not high cuisine ;) but once you get comfortable with this, hey do your experiments. Add vegetables or whatever. Also you can make one big meatloaf with the mix, but it will need more time in the oven. 

You need:
400gr ground beef
Tablespoon ketchup (or fancy Guinness bbq sauce or normal BBC sauce) 
Tablespoon mustard
1 whole egg
You can also add: some pinches of red pepper, onion powder, a bit of garlic powder or whatever you might seem fit, but I recommend starting very light, if you don't have much experience with spices. 
Salt (in my experience ground beef ""swallows"" salt, so rather generous, but still a sensible amount. You can always add more after preparation)
And the secret ingredient: fried crunchy onions (yes, the stuff you can buy prepared)... I use up to 100gr

That's it. Start heating your oven on 200°c/ 390-400F. Put all ingredients together in a bowl. Wash your hands (again) and then just mix everything with your hands.

Get an oven tray (I additionally always use baking paper).
Now form little flattish rounds of the above mixed stuff and put them on the tray. Leave a bit of space between them. Depending on the size of your tray you might have more of the mix than fits on the tray, then just repeat the oven step. Put the tray in the oven. Do stuff or sit around for 10 minutes.
Get the tray carefully (!) out of the oven and turn the flattish meat things. Put tray back in the oven. Do other stuff or go back to sitting around for 10 minutes. Get tray out of the oven. Place the flattish meatballs on a plate or such so they cool down. (do all the steps with the rest of the mix if there's still something left).

You have to store them in the fridge after they cooled down, if you don't eat them right away :)

Enjoy!

Bonus: potato salad (kinda Eastern German version)

Boil potatoes (don't cut, boil with skin, until you can stab one with a fork easily, but not too easy... You shouldn't use force, but it also shouldn't fall apart right away). 
Also hardboil 1-3 eggs. 
Drain and wait for the potatoes to cool.
Remove skin from potatoes. This usually is very easy when cooked right, you can just pull it from the potatoes.
Cut potatoes into little pieces (this is my last resort).
Put cut potatoes in a bowl.
Add cut eggs.
Peal and cut an apple (should rather not be a sweet one, but more a bit tangy, sour, to add some freshness) and add to bowl. 
Dice half an onion and add to bowl.
Cut some pickles (some, not many) and add to bowl.
Add salt and pepper. 

Now comes the complicated part ;) add mayonnaise, however: be sensible. The stuff should be coated in it and a tiny (!) bit more. Don't drown it in mayonnaise. It's a potato salad, not a mayo salad.

I'm wondering if meat or anything frozen defrosting in the fridge needs to be sealed someway or can I just leave it on a plate to thaw?

**""Rustic"" Chicken and Dumplings**

This comforting and hearty recipe may be the epitome of cooking with what you've got. I've always gone with my eyes and by feel/taste, so take my measurements with a very hefty grain of salt. At the end of the day we are making thick chicken soup and dropping biscuit dough in. Feel free to mix it up however you want using this foundation

**Ingredients for the chicken part**

4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (just trust me, okay)

1 medium onion, yellow or white

3 or 4 cloves of garlic, minced

A few tablespoons of oil or butter

4 cups of chicken stock, or enough to cover at least half of the chicken thighs (I use bullion and water)

Salt and pepper to taste

Aromatics of choice if desired/available

**Ingredients for the dumplings**

2 cups AP flour

2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)

1 teaspoon white sugar

Pinch of salt to taste

1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)

1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)

**Method**

Heat a large pot over medium heat and add oil/butter to coat the bottom. Rub chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and place skin side down into the pot.

While the chicken is browning, dice the onion roughly and mince the garlic.

Once the chicken thighs have gotten some color on the skin, flip them and add the onions. Let cook until the onions begin to soften.

After onions have softened, add minced garlic. Be sure to keep the garlic moving and be ready to take off the heat if it begins to burn at all.

After a few minutes the garlic should be a golden brown and the onion should be lightly caramelized. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the chicken stock (aim for the chicken to be at least halfway covered and seasonings of choice. Salt and pepper will be just fine, but if you want to add aromatics or other seasonings go for it. I basically never make it the same way twice. I suggest going a bit easy for now since ideally we want that chicken fully cooked before taste testing. We can always add more later.

Cover the pot and let simmer until the chicken begins to fall apart, at least 30 minutes.

To make the dumplings

Begin this process once the chicken is starting to get fully cooked and tender.

Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt thoroughly in a medium bowl. I like to add a bit of garlic powder as well but that's optional. Cut cold butter into small chunks and incorporate into the dry mixture. Use a fork, your hands, a stick, whatever. We just want small solid pieces of butter, roughly pea-sized.

Mix with utensil of choice until it forms into a very wet, shaggy dough. It will be sticky and almost more of a very thick batter when ready.

**To finish it up**

By this point, the chicken should be falling off the bone and shredding easily in the pot. Pull those bones out with tongs or really anything that's not your hand. Give the chicken a rustling to get it nice and broken up, and it's time to drop those dumplings!

Using a spoon or your hands, pull out small chunks of the dough/batter and drop them into the soup. It will be a bit sticky and messy, and it won't be a pageant winner visually. Once again I am asking you to trust me. Stay conservative on scooping the dumplings as they will at least double in size, typically more. A tablespoon or so per dumpling serves me well.

Cook uncovered for about 10 minutes, then cover and cook for about another 10 minutes, or until the dumplings have firmed up and doubled.

**EAT IT**

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! No need to let this rest. Go ahead and serve it up and eat it hot. If you are unsure of the doneness of the dumplings, pull one out and have a chef snack. It should be pillowy soft with just a bit of chew. Cooking for longer produces a chewier dumpling if that's what you prefer.

**Notes**

I know bone-in, skin-on thighs may raise some eyebrows. In my experience, it adds a ton of flavor and texture to the dish overall. Plus they are super cheap compared to other cuts. The skin is easy to take out after it's imparted it's delicious fatty flavor, if you prefer. Other cuts of chicken would also be fine if you'd like to go leaner, or if you only have a different cut on hand. If using white meat, be gentler on the heat and time.

The dumplings almost always end up being the star of the show, which is why I use drop dumplings instead of a more doughy dumpling. They are like pillowy flavor sponges and they thicken the broth on their own. If you prefer a thicker/chewier dumpling, add a bit more flour to the dough and/or cook a bit longer with the dumplings in.

This is a very simple base recipe, so feel free to go wild with add-ons. Throw in some peas and carrots, or add some sage or oregano.

This recipe is insanely cheap and keeps and heats up well, so no wonder it's been a go-to for feeding the family for so long. I've gotten it well below $0.75 per serving, and even with chicken breast it doesn't creep too far above a buck a bowl. Plus clean-up is minimal since we basically just use one pot and one bowl.

**BONUS RECIPE**

The dumpling recipe can be used exactly as is for drop biscuits so this recipe serves double duty. Whip up some dumplings, drop roughly golf ball sized balls onto a greased pan, and bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Top with melted butter, syrup, jam, or whatever you want.",cookingforbeginners,You can make Chicken and Dumplings from scratch much more easily than you think and it's very cheap!,1602943683,18,962,"You can make Chicken and Dumplings from scratch much more easily than you think and it's very cheap!

southerngentleman90,Recipe,88,"Seriously. It's basically just make liquid hot, add egg, stir. The way you doctor it up is completely up to you, but here's a very foundational recipe. This makes a single serving but can be scaled 1:1.

*Egg Drop Soup*

**Ingredients**

1 cup chicken broth (or broth of your choice)

1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste

A few drops of sesame oil

1 teaspoon cornstarch

2 teaspoons cold water

Pinch of salt if desired

White pepper to taste (I don't always have this on hand and black pepper also works fine)

**Method**

Mix together liquid ingredients in a small pot

Make a slurry using the cornstarch and just a bit of cold water. To do this, whisk the cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl briskly until it combines into a thick, almost batter-like, liquid. Doing this will prevent the cornstarch from clumping up in the soup.

Add slurry to the hot broth while stirring to thicken. Now is a good time to carefully take a taste and see how much salt and pepper it needs. I like my soups salty, but having already added broth and soy sauce, this one is often salty enough already.

THE FUN PART! Beat an egg and drop that bad boy in the pot once the water comes to a low boil. Immediately turn off the heat while stirring (in one direction) as the egg will continue to cook in the residual heat. You can let it boil while stirring for a moment if you like a firmer egg, but I enjoy them whispy.

Enjoy while hot! 

**Notes**

Stir either clockwise or counterclockwise, but not both. Stirring in one direction gives the eggs that whispy but fluffy texture.

The color will probably look a bit bland compared to what you are used to from takeout places. I assume they either add some coloring or maybe use a white soy sauce? I dunno, but this one is just as good.

I go easy on sesame oil because I find it can easily get overpowering, but feel free to add more if you love the stuff.

Keep it casual when making this. The base of it is broth, soy sauce, and egg, beyond that is your playground. This recipe is meant to be a jumping off point.

**Method**

Mix together liquid ingredients in a small pot

Make a slurry using the cornstarch and just a bit of cold water. To do this, whisk the cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl briskly until it combines into a thick, almost batter-like, liquid. Doing this will prevent the cornstarch from clumping up in the soup.

Add slurry to the hot broth while stirring to thicken. Now is a good time to carefully take a taste and see how much salt and pepper it needs. I like my soups salty, but having already added broth and soy sauce, this one is often salty enough already.

THE FUN PART! Beat an egg and drop that bad boy in the pot once the water comes to a low boil. Immediately turn off the heat while stirring (in one direction) as the egg will continue to cook in the residual heat. You can let it boil while stirring for a moment if you like a firmer egg, but I enjoy them whispy.

Enjoy while hot! 

**Notes**

Stir either clockwise or counterclockwise, but not both. Stirring in one direction gives the eggs that whispy but fluffy texture.

The color will probably look a bit bland compared to what you are used to from takeout places. I assume they either add some coloring or maybe use a white soy sauce? I dunno, but this one is just as good.

I go easy on sesame oil because I find it can easily get overpowering, but feel free to add more if you love the stuff.

Keep it casual when making this. The base of it is broth, soy sauce, and egg, beyond that is your playground. This recipe is meant to be a jumping off point. I'll include some variations in the comments."

I have soy sauce, worcestershire and that’s pretty much it. Anyone down to help me figure something out? The Mama Tangs, worcestershire and soy sauce, I have minced garlic and spices.. What can I use instead of dijon mustard or how could I make this any better? Does it sound terrible? 
Heres the [recipe](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/the-best-steak-marinade/) I’m referring to on website spendwithpennies"

They aren't going to win any beauty contests, but they are delicious, easy, and cheap.

I always eyeball the ingredients to scale for how many I need to cook, but here's a basic list so you can see the ratios:

**Ingredients**

2 cups AP flour

2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)

1 teaspoon white sugar

Pinch of salt to taste

1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)

1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)

**Method**

Mix the flour, baking powder, and sugar together. I like to put a bit of salt as well, although it's not necessary.

Take the cold butter and cut it into small pieces and add to the flour. At this point I use my hands to coat the butter chunks in flour and break it up by hand. I do this mostly because I'm lazy with dishes so I just do this whole recipe mixing with my hands. I've seen folks lightly freeze the butter and then use a cheese grater to add it in, which seems clever. I just keep it simple, the goal is simply to end up with small (maybe pea-sized) bits of still solid butter.

Add the cold milk a little bit at a time, mixing until a wet shaggy dough forms. Once again, I use my hands, but a spoon is probably the preferred method. What we want is a texture similar to an extra-thick flapjack batter, but a big thicker. It will be a bit sticky so don't worry about that. This is a fast and loose recipe, so don't worry about perfection.

Once a loose dough/batter is formed, it's time to drop those biscuits. Lightly oil a baking sheet and grab chunks of the dough and drop 'em on there. I go with slightly larger than golf ball sized, but this recipe ain't about being precise. Don't worry too much about shape, these are supposed to be tasty, not necessarily pretty.

Bake until golden brown at about 425 degrees. Usually this will take about 12-15 minutes, but just keep an eye on them and pull them when they look nice.

Try to contain your excitement and give them a minute before devouring. Give in, take a bite while they are still really hot, then do that funny breathing thing to keep them from scalding your tongue ;)",cookingforbeginners,"Add drop biscuits to your repertoire!

Anyway, enough about me. Some pictures with the pancakes https://imgur.com/gallery/LRRfo9C and I used this recipe : 
 
Ingredients : 
 - 5 Cups of Flour
 - 2 Tsp salt (or a little more if you want them salty)
 - 2 Cups of Almost boiling water

For the oil that you need to brush them before rolling

 - 6-7 Tblsp of vegatable oil + 1 tblsp of sesame oil
 - Salt and spices that you enjoy. Garlic, Onion powder. 
 - 4 Tblsp of flour

Procedure : 

 - You start by adding the flour in a bowl along with the salt and then the hot/almost boiling water. Mix it at low speed with the mixer, or use a wooden spoon.
 - Mix until everything combies and is not sticky. When you put your finger on the dough it should come out clean.
 - Let it rest for 10-15 minutes to cooldown a little covered with a plastic sheet and prepare the oil.
 - Put everything in a sauce pan and mix it at a low heat constantly to not get lumps of flour. When it starts to boil, you're done. 
 - Now, cut the dough in how many peices you would like. I cut mine in 8 smaller ones because is easier to fry them.
 - Roll them thin enough with a rolling pin, but not really thin. You should not be able to see trough it. You should have in mind 2 things. 
 - Long ---- and wide |   You should make it longer than wider. But keep in mind that the wider it is, the more layers you will have and those are a pleasure when you eat it.
 - After you roll the dough, brush it with the oil, this will help keeping those layers to not stick. Add the fillings Cheese, Scallions but be sure to not overfill.
 - After that, roll it as tight as you can from the wide part with your hand. Now you should have a roll. Take 1 end and roll it to the other. Press everything with the palm of your hand, add a little flour, and use the rolling pin to thin and form the pancake. Don't press TOO hard on it, and it doesn't matter if it brakes a little here and there. 
 - Fry in hot oil (don't deep fry), 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
 - You can enjoy it with some cream cheese! 

I really hope this will help someone to make it at home. They're SUPER GOOD and a pleasure to eat. Just watch some videos on how to exactly roll the dough because I can't explain it more than this, and you're done. All you need is 1 bowl to mix things together.

If you insert a toothpick into the middle and it comes out with wet ingredients stuck to it, leave the brownies in for another five minutes. When the toothpick comes out with crumbs on it, or clean, the brownies are done. Let them cool off for five or ten minutes, then dig in!

I've never made brownies before, craved them two weeks ago and began testing different on-line recipes. Not finding the right fudge-y-ness or flavour (and getting annoyed at the recipe websites that make you scroll through someone's life story, pop ups and a photo of every ingredient to get to the recipe- because we don't know what eggs look like, right /s), I figured out the best ingredient ratio and came up with this. I've made them six times now in the past two weeks, love how fudge-y they are with the perfect slight crust on top mmm! Everyone loves them, hope you like them too."

TraditionalCoffee,Question,5,"All my cooking life, I’ve faced the dry chicken cubes problem.

To me, it appears that chicken is quick to lose moisture if cooked at low temperatures. 

Preparing chicken for a curry: Chop some chicken breast and..

-Put in a slow cooker - It’ll lose all moisture. 
-Put it in the oven - Again, it’ll drown. 
-Sear each cube on a super hot cast iron skillet and then in drop it in a hot curry...This works!! But searing each cube takes a long time.

Next, I’m going to try to preheat my oven to 250c, and sliding my chicken cubes with gaps between them (I think cramming the chicken on a tray won’t allow proper exposure to the super hot oven, so it’ll lose moisture).

happypuppy100,Request,1,"I saw a question on here about deep frying + batter, and it had lots of uneducated replies, so I googled it and checked on it

&amp;#x200B;

**Is there a lot of oil on deep frying food?**

No, unless they're overcooked there

might be a few grams of oil left, tops.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is oil left on food when deep frying?**

very little oil remains with food

because steaming action prevented it from penetrating.

Simply because deep frying is associate with oil doesn't mean it has lots of oil it

&amp;#x200B;

**What is deep frying?**

Frying is a cooking technique where heat is transferred to a food : from hot oil that surrounds it.

See source: [https://frymax.co.uk/frying-oil/what-is-frying-science-of-frying/](https://frymax.co.uk/frying-oil/what-is-frying-science-of-frying/)

&amp;#x200B;

Frying occurs when a food is introduced to hot oil and rapidly begins to dehydrate.

When food is submerged in oil, water within ingredient immediately starts to boil and rise to surface, causing free fatty acids to form.

A starchy crust around outside helps to lock in moisture, preventing food from becoming completely dehydrated.

See source: [https://www.masterclass.com/articles/cooking-101-learn-the-science-of-frying-plus-20-recipe-ideas-for-frying-at-home#how-does-frying-work](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/cooking-101-learn-the-science-of-frying-plus-20-recipe-ideas-for-frying-at-home#how-does-frying-work)

&amp;#x200B;

Deep frying is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, as opposed to shallow oil used in conventional frying done in a frying pan.

**Why do deep-fried foods taste so good?**

Various chemical and physical changes occur in deep-frying, including Maillard reaction which causes aromatic browning to occur on crunchy crust

food scientist [Harold McGee](http://www.curiouscook.com/) and this new video from PBS show [""Mind of a Chef,""](http://www.pbs.org/food/shows/the-mind-of-a-chef/) we now have a better understanding of how frying food actually works.

&amp;#x200B;

basic frying process involves simultaneous complex and dynamic events. frying medium (fat or oil) is heated to high temperatures,  and foods containing various mixes of proteins, carbohydrates, their own lipid material, water, seasonings, salt, etc., cause a nearly infinite number of potential chemical reactions.

AGDude,Recipe,0,"Make this if you want a delicious breakfast treat.

For those who have never had a Big Apple, it's kind of like a pancake, but softer and sweeter.  This is easy to make.  It's also fast: 5-10 minutes of prep work and 15 minutes to cook.  It's a delicious recipe.  Made it this morning and it was very easy.  This particular recipe is from [CD Kitchen](https://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/recs/1856/Bickfords-Big-Apple-Pancake122476.shtml), but there are dozens of largely identical variations all over the internet (probably from Bickford's employees independently sharing them).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ingredients:  
&gt;  
&gt;• 1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
&gt;  
&gt;• 1/2 cup milk  
&gt;  
&gt;• 2 eggs  
&gt;  
&gt;• 2 tablespoons margarine OR butter, melted  
&gt;  
&gt;• 2 medium apples, peeled, cored, sliced  
&gt;  
&gt;• 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar  
&gt;  
&gt;• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Instructions:  
&gt;  
&gt;Combine flour, milk, and eggs. Pour melted margarine in 9"" pie plate. Pour mixture into pan. Combine remaining ingredients and pour evenly into pie pan.

&gt;Bake in 425 degree F oven for 15 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

My comments: 

* I used 1 Honeycrisp and 1 Granny Smith.  I don't think it really matters, though.
* I used Bisquick because I lacked flour.  It worked fine.
* I recommend mixing apples/sugar/cinamon by sticking them a plastic container and shaking until apples are coated, turning the container upside-down a few times as you shake to prevent sugar/cinammon from sitting at the bottom.
* **Grease the pan**.  The butter at the bottom won't stop the pancake from sticking to the sides of the pan.
* 15 minutes is a minimum.  Plenty of recipes suggest 20 minutes.
* Most recipes recommend broiling for 1-2 minutes after baking.  I didn't bother.
* Consider adding an extra egg if you want eggier dough.",cookingforbeginners,Bickford's Big Apple,1602176750,3,319,"Bickford's Big Apple Make this if you want a delicious breakfast treat.

SnoopLog,Recipe,1,"Homemade Ricotta is really really easy - it takes only a few minutes of active time. This is my recipe for it - it's
[perfect on toast, or even plain.](https://imgur.com/a/QgQJxmj)

--WRITTEN RECIPE--

1L whole milk
100ml double cream (heavy cream)
30ml distilled white vinegar
Cheesecloth / thin kitchen towel


Let's Start…
Gently heat the milk and cream until tiny bubbles begin to form, and the milk is just steaming
(around 82C/ 180F).

Remove from the heat and slowly stream in the white vinegar. Leave to rest for ~ 5 minutes. At
this point, the milk will begin to separate into curds (solid) and whey (liquid).

Place a cheesecloth, or a very thin kitchen towel in a colander and then place the colander in a
large heatproof bowl.

Pour the curds and the whey over the cheescloth and leave to rest for ~20 minutes, or until
desired consistency is reached.

Spoon the curds into sealable container, optionally add salt, and store in fridge.

Serve on toast, with fresh fruit and honey.


NOTES

Traditional ricotta is generally made by reheating the whey (ricotta = ‘re-cooked’), but this

[perfect on toast, or even plain.](https://imgur.com/a/QgQJxmj)

--WRITTEN RECIPE--

1L whole milk
100ml double cream (heavy cream)
30ml distilled white vinegar
Cheesecloth / thin kitchen towel


Let's Start…
Gently heat the milk and cream until tiny bubbles begin to form, and the milk is just steaming
(around 82C/ 180F).

Remove from the heat and slowly stream in the white vinegar. Leave to rest for ~ 5 minutes. At
this point, the milk will begin to separate into curds (solid) and whey (liquid).

Place a cheesecloth, or a very thin kitchen towel in a colander and then place the colander in a
large heatproof bowl.

Pour the curds and the whey over the cheescloth and leave to rest for ~20 minutes, or until
desired consistency is reached.

Spoon the curds into sealable container, optionally add salt, and store in fridge.

Serve on toast, with fresh fruit and honey.


NOTES

Traditional ricotta is generally made by reheating the whey (ricotta = ‘re-cooked’), but this
usually has a very low yield, and requires you to have whey on hand in the first place. More
modern methods use a mixture of milk and cream to yield a product that is similar in taste,
but much higher in yield (the whey type of ricotta is more commonly known as ‘ricottone’)."
Synthwolfe,Question,7,"So, my grandmother's 65th birthday is next week, and i want to do something truly special for her. My specialty is frying, searing, grilling, and desserts, but i usually stick with the basics for desserts. 

My issue is that I wanted to do a no bake cheesecake (my family has an heirloom recipe i use), but i also wanted to make it a carrot cake flavor. My issue is that i cant figure out which flavors to include to at least closely match the taste of carrot cake. 

I got the frosting down (very thin layer of butter cream on top), and i know the basic flavors, but i can quite manage to pin down the right amounts. Either it turns to a nutmeg cake, a raisin cake, or a vanilla cake. Antone able to weigh in?

Also, I'm not sure if this is appropriate here, since its not really a beginner question (to be honest, any carrot cake is rather advanced), but I have less than a week now, so im a bit stressed on this lol.",cookingforbeginners,Carrot cake flavored no bake cheesecake,1602087412,6,177,"Carrot cake flavored no bake cheesecake So, my grandmother's 65th birthday is next week, and i want to do something truly special for her.

zippopwnage,Recipe,0,"Calzone? Seinfeld? 
Hey I'm George again, and today I'm making my first Calzones! And not only that, but I'm trying the fillings from Seinfeld. (In a way)
I made pizza before but not Calzones. I think the hardest part was to seal them. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/XqgXtxM

Recipe for the dough : 

 - 650g flour
 - 7g dried yeast
 - salt
 - 25-30ml olive oil
 -325 ml of warm water
 - pinch of sugar for the water and yeast.
 - I also added 25 ml more of water later after some kneading. 
 - Cooked at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown
 - Butter to brush after is done

Filling :

 - (For the Seinfeld one) Eggplant, Ricotta Cheese, Mozzarella, Pepperoni
For my own fillings (I made more than 1)
 - (Precooked) : Bacon, Onion, Kapia Peppers, Eggplant
 - Mushrooms, Salami, Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Smoked Cheese, Tomato Sauce with Basil.

If you have any questions..please ask. I'm more than happy to answer or talk about this recipe (Or any recipe tbh).

Procedure :

 - Add the flour into a bowl. Add the yeast into the warm water with a pinch of sugar and mix it together.
 - Let it sit for 5 minutes. 
 - Cut the eggplant in slices, and salt both sides. Let it sit for 20-30 minutes to release the bitter water, that you will have to wipe off with a napkin.
 - Now put the water with the yeast into the flour. Mix with a wooden spoon or your dough mixer. I personally only used 1 bowl with 1 wooden spoon.
 - Mix until everything almost combine. Then use your hand. At this time it should not be super sticky and is gonna be easy to kneed.
 - After mixing with your hand for 2-5 minutes, if everything's too dry, add 25 ml of water more (I needed to add). 
 - Now mix a little more, until the dough is not sticky anymore. Mine was not sticky at all. When you press it with your finger it should not stick to it.
 - Let it rest for at least 1 hour
Now you can precook some of the ingredients. 
 - After wipping the eggplant, put some oil on it, and put it in the oven at 180 degree Celsius for 30-ish minutes.
 - Get the kapia/redbell pepper and an onion and cook it in a pan with a little oil + some butter until the onion is translucent and the kapia/bellpepper is soft. 
 - Add salt and pepper
 - Bacon, you cook it in the oven on a cooking rack until crisp. 

Now the hardest part (at least for me) shaping the Calzone. I cut my dough in 8 small/medium calzone's. You can cut yours how you want.
You need to shape the dough in an oval shape. (For me shaping the dough is really hard)
After that, don't overfill your Calzone, otherwise you will have problems sealing it. For the Seinfield one, you need to add Cheese, Pepperoni and Eggplant. 
For the rest, fill them as you'd like. I suggest starting with a layer of Tomato Sauce or Ricotta Cheese. After that, use whatever your hearth tells you.
You need to cover the filling with a part of the dough, and shape it. To seal it, I did a twist in the back corners, and the rest I rotate it and pinch it. 
You can mix some water with flour into a small bowl and use that as a ""glue"", but you still have to pinch it.

Now cook it at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown. When you get them out of the oven, have some melted butter to brush on top of them.

Ingredients

* 2 knobs of butter
* large handful spinach
* 2 free-range eggs
* 15g/½oz cheddar, grated
* salt and freshly ground black pepper

Method

1. Melt   a knob of butter in a frying pan placed over a medium heat. Add the   spinach and cook for 1–2 minutes, until wilted. Season with salt and   pepper. Tip out onto a plate and set aside.
2. In   a bowl, beat the eggs until just mixed. Return the frying pan to a   medium–high heat, add the remaining butter and melt until beginning to   foam, then swirl it around the pan.
3. Pour in the beaten eggs, then tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly. Leave for 20 seconds, until the eggs begin to bubble.
4. Working   quickly, use a spatula or wooden spoon to draw in the sides of the  eggs  to the centre, incorporating the butter. Gently shake the pan to   redistribute the egg to the edges.
5. Sprinkle   over the cheese and spinach while the egg is still slightly runny in   the middle, then remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will   continue to cook the egg. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Using   a spatula, fold one third of the omelette into the middle, then turn   the omelette onto a warm plate folding over itself. Serve immediately.

Simple and Budget Cheese Toastie – You don’t need a special gadget to make a superb cheese toastie – a simple frying pan will do. Grate the cheese and add a dollop of Greek yoghurt to give the filling a good texture and tangy taste, balancing out the acidity with a swipe of your favourite chutney.

* **Preparation time** / less than 30 mins
* **Cooking time** / less than 10 mins
* **Serves** / Serves 1

#### Ingredients

* 2 medium–thick slices bread, buttered on one side
* ½–1 tbsp chutney
* 1 slice ham (optional)
* 1 cornichon, sliced (optional)
* green salad, to serve

#### For the filling

* 1 tbsp full-fat Greek yoghurt
* 1 tbsp finely chopped chives or ½ finely chopped spring onion
* 25g/1oz coarsely grated cheddar (or another hard cheese, such as emmental, Gruyère, Red Leicester or a mixture)

#### Method

1. To make the filling, mix the yoghurt with the chives or spring onion. Stir in the grated cheese.
2. Place the bread slices on a chopping board, buttered-side down. Spread one with chutney and top the other with the cheese filling. Lay the ham and cornichon on top, if using. Put the chutney-spread piece of bread on top of the cheesy piece, buttered-side up.
3. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Put the sandwich in the pan and fry for 3 minutes on one side, pressing down lightly with a spatula every so often, or until the bread is golden brown. Carefully turn over, using your spatula and another flattish implement, such as a palette knife or the back of a wooden spoon. Fry for a further 2 minutes or until crisp and golden.
4. Cut the sandwich in half and serve with a green salad.

SO EASY. Literally so so soooo easy. It was my first time making and it came out perfect. 

Pumpkin purée (I home made this by cutting, gutting, pealing, and boiling a pumpkin until it was soft and mashed it together) 
And flour! 

The ratios I read online didn’t work, so just what I did is slowly added flour until I got a consistency like I saw in a random YouTube video on gnocchi. It looks like normal pasta dough. 

In the end.. I probably had ½ pumpkin to 2 cups or 2.5 cups flour. I think it was too much flour but I just went until it wasn’t sticky anymore. Add to boiling water and remove when it floats. This made 17 little gnocchis and definitely wasn’t enough for 2 people, but I didn’t want to make too much in case it taste bad lol 

I did my “test” batch with butter and it was really good, and my “real” batch I used some prepackaged garlic cream sauce.

vichn,Recipe,0,"Hi everyone!

I've just made an easy marinade for [duck filet](https://ibb.co/gyTMbKN) I thought of years ago on the go while making a lamb in the wood oven. Turns out, my memory didn't fail and it's amazing as before! I love the Mediterranean influence, and maybe I picked the recipe up somewhere - but it's worthy of trying out for other people. This marinade might also work for veal and other small game, and is not suitable for pork or fish.

The recipe for \~300-500 grams of meat:

\- 30 grams of honey  
\- 30-50 grams of dry/semi-sweet white wine (Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio worked great for me as they don't have the heavy spirit smell)  
\- a branch of fresh rosemary, leafs torn into small pieces (this is important - while other Mediterranean herbs can be used in a dry form here, fresh rosemary will dominate through other ingredients and is the main accent smell here)  
\- 1 teaspoon of dry Mediterranean herbs blend  
\- 2 large cloves of garlic  
\- 1/2 teaspoon of salt  
\- 1/2 teaspoon of four peppercorns blend

Bake for an hour at 180-200­°C and finish with 10 minutes of 300°C. Don't open the oven door and let it rest until the temperature falls below 100°C.

If you don't add any other seasoning or sauce to the meal cooked in this marinade, the subtle smells of garlic, honey, rosemary, and dry wine will taste like a good sauce on itself.

Its just a 3 egg bacon, onion, tomato, and cheddar omelette I whipped up this morning using some of the leftover veggies from taco night last night.

I found the key to keeping it from devolving into a scramble was patience.  It takes longer than you think it would for the eggs to set completely before trying to fold.

Ingredients:

2 pats of butter

1/8 yellow onion diced

1 Roma tomato diced

3 strips of bacon fried crispy and diced

1/3 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese

3 large eggs

Steps:

Fry bacon and set aside to cool

Scramble eggs and set aside

Melt 1 pat of butter in small non-stick skillet (I used an 8 inch skillet)

Add onions and cook over medium heat until lightly browned then add diced tomato and cook for about another minute then set aside

Melt second pat of butter to pan

Add eggs to pan and cook over medium heat until 1 side is completely set, don't stir too much.

Flip eggs and allow second side to set completely (I was able to flip the eggs by wrist flicking the pan, somehow got lucky and didn't spill eggs everywhere)

You should now have a kind of scrambled egg patty in your pan.

Layer ingredients on one half of the omelette starting and ending with cheese to melt to form a glue, leave a bit of each for garnish

Cook until cheese is melted and ingredients are warm

Transfer to plate, garnish with left over ingredients and serve.

This whole process took me about 20 minutes total.",cookingforbeginners,Small victory - my first omelette that didn't turn into a scramble,1601750834,12,242,"Small victory - my first omelette that didn't turn into a scramble [https://imgur.com/CxWH9rf](https://imgur.com/CxWH9rf)

soffglutinous,Request,20,"Alright, so you've probably gotten this question a thousand times. College student looking for something quick, easy and cheap to cook and eat. I've looked through this Reddit however and haven't found much to help me.

I have trouble during college. I wake up at around 7.30am, classes start at 9. Most days I have them up until 1-2PM. Problem is, I get EXTREMELY hungry around 11am even though I've eaten breakfast, like, uncomfortable-hunger-pains hungry, even though I'm not actually hungry myself. My brain apparently burns a shitton of calories during class or when I'm working on assignments, because I never have these problems during weekends or the holidays and can go half a day without eating just fine!

I don't feel like eating in the morning most days but I have to force myself or suffer even more, and honestly I've gotten sick of just eating bagels with yoghurt or cream cheese spreads. I'd skip breakfast if I could, but that just makes me crash from low blood sugar quickly.

I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for good and quick breakfast recipes, or not even breakfast recipes but light and filling meals. We don't have big breaks in between classes and eating during class is out of the question, so my only options are either to bring something with me to snack on that's small and light, or eat a good breakfast and toughen it out until lunch. (I've tried drinking water and it barely helps, btw.)

I would greatly appreciate it if you could suggest some recipes that use very common, or at least less ""niche"" ingredients - I live in Europe and a lot of the healthy/alternative ingredients you guys love aren't available here, or are very uncommon. I'm not against trying to find them, though. 

Our standard yoghurt is non-sweetened. Zwieback is a lighter alternative to bread that's a staple, pate is a common household breakfast/dinner food, lots of cream cheese options, and other stuff... It's not that I'm exactly lacking options, I'm just extremely uncreative with my food and don't like it when I have to spend a lot of time prepping my food. Also, having to get a ton of specific ingredients just for one recipe that can't be reused or stuff is a goddamn pain.

If I could eat eggs, probably all of these issues would be so easily avoided, but oh well.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could suggest some recipes that use very common, or at least less ""niche"" ingredients - I live in Europe and a lot of the healthy/alternative ingredients you guys love aren't available here, or are very uncommon. I'm not against trying to find them, though. 

Our standard yoghurt is non-sweetened. Zwieback is a lighter alternative to bread that's a staple, pate is a common household breakfast/dinner food, lots of cream cheese options, and other stuff... It's not that I'm exactly lacking options, I'm just extremely uncreative with my food and don't like it when I have to spend a lot of time prepping my food. Also, having to get a ton of specific ingredients just for one recipe that can't be reused or stuff is a goddamn pain.

If I could eat eggs, probably all of these issues would be so easily avoided, but oh well. Stuffing myself like a pig during lunch won't help me lose weight either...."

○Ingredients 
1 stick of butter 

4 slices of bread (any kind will do) 

1 block of craft sharp cheddar cheese 

1 can of festia black beans 

Optional 
Pickle chips or any kind of chip 

●HOW TO COOK 

Start by cutting your cheddar cheese, start with 8 and if that's not enough or you like cheese cut more. You're basically making a grilled cheese but real cheesy. Get out a skillet and put the heat on medium. After the skillet has heated for a few minutes take you stick of butter and rub it on the skillet. After that take your sandwich you made and put it on there until that side is crispy. Once crispy rub some more butter on the skillet. Dont worry about the cheese it will get melted if not turn it up a little but make sure it doesn't burn. After the grilled cheese is done repeat steps with how ever many you want. Next get a small sauce pan and put your beans in the sauce pan. Heat until hot After that surve up and enjoy. :)

I've also lived in this housing program where they prepare food for the clients, and I want to start being more self reliant, especially since the food...isn't always the best. The problem is that when I want to start cooking, all the recipe ideas I see online are so complicating, and I just want something nice and easy to start out with. Especially I get tired. I don't want to be a chef every day, you know? So basically I'm looking for good ideas for lunch and dinner. I have several ideas of what I want:  


1. Not TOO many ingredients or steps. I once made this vegetable sandwich with sautéed eggplant, squash, red bell pepper, and red onion. That was simple enough for me and it tasted great.
2. I don't want meat when I can help it. The housing program serves meat in a lot of the meals, and I feel like I've been eating too much of it. The problem is that I don't know of many ideas that don't have meat in them.
3. I also have a lactose intolerance, so the less cheese, the better.
4. I'd like it to be something I can make within just the span of an hour, since the housing program allows people to make their own food, but only within that amount of time.

I've also lived in this housing program where they prepare food for the clients, and I want to start being more self reliant, especially since the food...isn't always the best. The problem is that when I want to start cooking, all the recipe ideas I see online are so complicating, and I just want something nice and easy to start out with. Especially I get tired. I don't want to be a chef every day, you know? So basically I'm looking for good ideas for lunch and dinner. I have several ideas of what I want:  


1. Not TOO many ingredients or steps. I once made this vegetable sandwich with sautéed eggplant, squash, red bell pepper, and red onion. That was simple enough for me and it tasted great.
2. I don't want meat when I can help it. The housing program serves meat in a lot of the meals, and I feel like I've been eating too much of it. The problem is that I don't know of many ideas that don't have meat in them.
3. I also have a lactose intolerance, so the less cheese, the better.
4. I'd like it to be something I can make within just the span of an hour, since the housing program allows people to make their own food, but only within that amount of time.

Ingredients:

Egg (however many you want to make) 

Soy sauce

Recipe: 

1) Crack the egg and separate the yolk and egg white. 

2) Put the egg yolk into a bowl 

3) Cover the egg yolk in soy sauce until it just about covers the top 

4) Cover the bowl in plastic wrap 

5) Refrigerate for 6 hours to 1 day (swirl the yolk around the bowl from time to time so that the soy sauce covers the top) 

6) Take it out of the fridge when ready to serve

If marinating for more than 1 day, put 1/3 less soy sauce and replace the 1/3 with mirin.

You can eat it with rice or like the manga also suggests, an avocado or rice ball (a 3 day marinade is needed to make the egg yolk firm enough for the rice ball).

wtfsomebody,Question,13,"i’m a college student and lately have been trying to learn how to cook more since i’m doing online classes and have more time than i usually do when i’m running around on campus. i’ve been trying some recipes online and trying to cook some other basic things like eggs, pasta, rice, etc. 

however, lately i’ve been extremely frustrated because i feel like no matter what i cook, the food just always comes out bad. i’ll follow recipes exactly as they say, i’ll watch cooking videos, read cooking articles, etc and then when i cook the actual food it just tastes... bad. 

it’s so frustrating to me because not only did i waste my time and put all that effort into something that was gross, but i also HATE wasting food, and im a broke college student so it’s not fun to spend money on groceries only for those groceries to end up being wasted because the food i cooked with it tasted bad. 

i’m guessing the problem is that my seasonings are off? to be honest, i’m not that great at knowing what proportions of seasoning go together (like i’m pretty sure you don’t add equal amounts of the seasonings like 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tbsp paprika, etc) so i think that’s probably making the food taste off because if i’m not following a recipe i usually just put in an amount that i feel like would be good  (spoiler alert: it’s usually not that great) 

and i know the whole “taste as you go” thing but that’s kinda not a solution for when i’m trying to season raw meats, salmon, etc. i also feel a bit “scared” of salt in the sense that in the past i’ve added WAYY too much salt and now in response i feel like i under-salt all my food but i never can tell because when i’m trying the food to see what it tastes like, i can’t tell exactly what it is that’s missing. like should i add more salt? more garlic powder? paprika? cumin? etc. did i add too much seasoning? did i not add enough? etc so overall i just get really disheartened because i feel like i just suck at cooking. 

so, if anyone has any advice on how to get better at cooking so that i can enjoy the food i make and not waste my time/effort/money/food, i would really appreciate it because at this point i feel like i’m just cursed and any food i touch just  turns bad :((( but im still trying to have a positive outlook and hope that going forward i’ll get better and start to enjoy the food i’m making.

I’ve been cooking tenderloins that are for chicken fingers on the pan sautéed bare so it’s healthier.

Grape seed oil with salt, pepper, thyme, parsley and lemon in the oven at 400 for 23 minutes. I thought it was okay. I cut them all down the middle and it looked good. I ran my finger on them and it had that cooked texture. So I took a sliver and ate a few bites. I randomly took a bit from a thicker side and the color didn’t look white. Pinkish? Maybe? I don’t know so I put the rest back in the oven for 8 more minutes. Couldn’t really tell so another 8 and. Now it’s so hard to pull the chicken apart and dry but it still doesn’t look white. I’m such a fucking mess like why can’t I cook chicken and not get myself sick. I’m so stressed I spend like $14 on these breasts which is a lot for me and I just want to throw them out.

pearlday,Question,6,"I'm a beginner cook that has burned oil, soup, and egg. Yes, this means that I've nearly ruined a few expensive pans in the past year... but they managed to survive with a lot of scrubbing. Anywho, the only thing I can make consistently is a fairly edible/decent chicken fajita. But... I want to improve so that it is more flavorful, if anyone has tips based on the following recipe/setup:

I live in an apartment with an electric stove, no grill. I use a wok.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I pre-cut red/green/yellow peppers (whichever we have, usually 2-3 peppers)
2. I pre-cut 2 pieces of chicken into small bits
3. I pre-cut 1-2 onions
4. I add some amount of oil to the pan (please don't kill me, my adhd makes portion measuring a nightmare for me). Usually it's enough to have a full thin layer on the pan.
5. I dump the chicken and stir until it's a bit brown
6. I add a bit of soy sauce just to give it a bit of flavor. Not conventional, I have no idea what other sauce to add in the beginning that can oomph it up?
7. Once the chicken is brownish I add the onions and stir until those are a bit translucent
8. By this point I add whatever spices, shake some oregano, cilantro, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, a fuck ton of paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, chili flakes, sometimes a hint of hot sauce-- i think that covers it
9. Once the onions are translucent I add the peppers.... and usually undercook them
10. Add some lime, cut in half so it's two halves of lime added
11. Somewhere in this I ask my bf to get the rice going in the instant pot
12. Once the rice is done I combine it into the wok and self-serve

Now while this might sound good or horrible, I have no idea. The food is okay, I don't know how to improve this? If anyone has ideas? I think the spices might be getting over cooked, but I want to make sure the chicken itself has flavor. Short story is I precut, dump the stuff into the pan, add some spice, dump more stuff into the pan, add rice, then serve. I tried cooking each item separately, like cooking the chicken then removing the chicken to add the onions... and that ended up being a disaster. So I'm looking for help or ideas that don't involve too much juggling.

GamersPlane,Question,6,"I'm trying to do more home cooking, and was in a mood for a mushroom dish. I found [this recipe](https://www.lifeasastrawberry.com/creamy-mushroom-and-garlic-sauce/) online, and the flavors sounded like up my alley. I actually took the garlic up a lot (5 cloves instead of 2). I also ended up sautéing half a red onion (half way done before adding in the mushroom) instead of adding in green onion. I also used the 3/4 a lb of pasta as recommended, as I prefer my pasta saucier.

I went through, made it all, and it came out... meh. First problem is the pasta (used fine spaghetti) stuck together, so I couldn't toss it well in the sauce, and there wasn't even incorporation. The mushrooms came out well, but I didn't get anything from the onion. It wasn't particularly cheesy, it wasn't garlicy at all, and I've now had it for the last few nights, mostly because I don't want to throw away perfectly good food.

Anyone know or have any idea where I went wrong? I love garlic, so going from 2 to 5 gloves and not getting strong flavor was really disappointing. Using 2/3 a cup of fresh grated parmesan and it neither being cheesy or flavorful meant a bunch of fat without any real return (I've seen some other recipes recommend Pecorino Romano, but I don't know if that's a globally better alternative to parmesan, or in certain situations).

I'm also starting to post these recipes on my new-ish youtube channel. I want to make these recipes really easy, and I really believe that if I can make the recipe, for sure you can do it better! I also try to talk about what I did wrong or good, and what I would change.

For example, on this recipe I think it would have been better to put the cake in a round smaller form, instead of a rectangular one that I used. 

The recipe I used : 

 - 1 cup and a half all-purpose flour or 200-215 grams
 - 1 tsp baking powder
 - 1/4 tsp baking soda
 - 1 + 1/4 tsp cinnamon (I put 1 and a half basically)
 - pinch of nutmeg
 - 2 eggs furiously beaten
 - 2 cups and a half shredded/grated carrots
 - Almost 1 cup of brown sugar, a little white sugar and 10 grams of vanilla sugar
 - 1/2 cup canola oil or vegetable oil
 - We also added vanilla essence and a little of almond essence. (Add by taste)
 - Baked at 170 degree Celsius for 25-30 minutes

Pheophyting,Question,43,"I usually drain the can of liquids as best as possible and toss the tuna into a pan at low heat and a bit of oil.

I always added dill and lemon juice to it to make it less...I dunno fishy? And it seems to work well. I season the tuna with a bit of salt and pepper as well.

My first few iterations featured tuna that was much too dry and crumbly so I added a beaten egg to the tuna (cooking in the pan) which sorta keeps the entire thing together and makes it a bit more moist which is nice.

I add provolone cheese slices honestly because I just like cheese and it seems like what I'm supposed to do for sandwiches/burgers. No idea if it actually makes it taste better. I think it does.

Once it's been in the pan for a several minutes and the egg is fully cooked through and the cheese is melted, I slap it on some toasted bread or hamburger buns.

nutritionacc,Recipe,43,"I want to preface this by saying that this post is not for touting supposed health benefits of MCT oil or a diet of any kind. I will simply be focusing on properties of MCT Oil that are useful in a culinary application.  

For anyone who doesn't know what MCT oil is: MCT oil is a fractionated oil consisting of medium chain triglycerides. It is most often made by separating medium chain triglycerides from coconut or palm oil. Higher end MCT Oils will not include lauric acid (C12) as a component. MCT Oil without lauric acid is what im referring to here.

Onto the applications:

MCT oil has an extremely low viscosity, being less viscous than even water. MCT Oil will barely solidify in the freezer due its extremely low melting point. This means that MCT oil can be used to thin out pastes and nut butters without adding a lot of oil. As little as half a tablespoon is able to turn a pint of nut butter into a pourable spread without diluting it (as would be done by adding multiple tablespoons of vegetable oil). 

Due to MCT oil's viscosity, it drains away from fried food very quickly and can help in minimising grease residue. Do beware of its 320f smoke point though.

Furthermore, mct oil can be used on pans to create an extremely thin film of oil in the centre of the pan, with the rest of oil going to the edges. This is useful for pancakes that require even browning and makes it so that you don't have to add oil and then wipe it down for each pancake (just swirl the pan).

This thin film of oil due to low viscosity concept can also be applied to coating foods with oil, as MCT oil will provide the thinnest film of oil possible when you coat something with it, like say potatoes in the oven. This minimises greasiness in the final product. 

Being 100% saturated, MCT oil fries foods better than all other oils, as found by [Kenji Lopez Alt](https://medium.com/sfcooking/how-to-make-the-perfect-french-fry-recipe-development-with-j-kenji-lopez-alt-serious-eats-ebf24848c263). Frying eggs in MCT oil has yielded me the most puffed and perfectly golden brown bottom eggs I have ever seen. The extent to which MCT oil can displace water is incredible and truly has some insane applications.

I use a rub high in salt that I leave on overnight and than sear both sides before adding to my liquid

For my broth I do 3 cups beef broth, 2 tablespoons worshire, a good dollop of tomato paste, and mustard. I also use a packet of seasoning mix that comes with my potatoes (couldnt tell you exactly whats in it but its salty)

for veggies I do carrots, garlic, small potatoes, white onion, yellow onion. all of my veggies are sauteed till fragrant before I add them

+ Hard to change things around while keeping the calories in check as well as a nutritional balance. 
+ Busy and demotivated, so cooking for long periods of time is a no go.

+ Cook batch of rice for a few days
+ For every meal, cook veggies and protein, warm up the rice. I also usually have a lettuce and tomato salad and some fruit.

MadeLAYline,Recipe,3,"Hi! 

This is a fairly easy and healthy recipe you can try to make at home if you are looking for a pasta substitute. All you need is a stove top and oven. [final result](https://imgur.com/a/ru3k0Q8)

Serving size: 1.5 to 2 people (depends on how hungry you are) 

Ingredients: 
- 1 spaghetti squash (size of a grapefruit)
- 1/2 cup bacon sliced into bite sized pieces
- 3-5 garlic cloves thinly sliced (1/4 cup) 
- half an onion chopped (1/4 cup) 
- 1 cup tomato sauce 
- 1/4 cup water (or less to dilute the sauce) 
- 1 tablespoon sugar 
- salt and pepper to taste 
- bonus: cheese toppings 

Directions:
- preheat oven to 400°F. 
- cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, remove the seeds and middle portion. 
- Drizzle lightly with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Don’t over drizzle because it’ll make it soggy. 
- Place on baking pan lined with aluminum foil facing down. Poke holes on the backside/skin side with a fork or knife. (Bonus: rub some oil on the aluminum so the squash doesn’t stick)
- Place in oven and bake for 30-40 mins. You want to be able to poke the fleshy part with a fork easily. It will come apart in small strands. Remember, the smaller the squash, the faster it will cook. 
- Once done, remove from oven. Use a fork to start scraping the inside until it’s all in small strands. You can let it cool a little bit while making the sauce so you don’t burn yourself or you can make the sauce while waiting for the squash to cook. 

- in a small pan, pour a tablespoon of oil (whatever you want) and add the garlic on medium heat and stir to prevent sticking. 
- once the garlic starts to become fragrant, add the bacon slices. stir occasionally to prevent sticking. 
- once bacon slices are 50% cooked, add onions and cook until transparent. 
- pour your tomato sauce, mix thoroughly, and cover until it simmers. If the sauce is too sticky for you, add a small amount of water. A few tablespoons at a time until you are satisfied with the consistency. 
- add sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix once more and turn off the fire once the sauce simmers. 

I transferred my shredded spaghetti squash onto a plate and poured the sauce and sprinkled the cheese on top. I’ve seen recipes where they keep the squash shredded in it’s skin/husk. Completely up to you. 

Once you get comfortable with the recipe, you can substitute any meat (or no meat) to the sauce recipe or change it up completely but the way to cook the squash stays the same. Spaghetti squash usually tastes good with pasta sauces.

B99fanboy,Question,6," I normally don't use garlic paste but I like the taste of garlic, I love garlic pickle, but I use garlic only in finely chopped pieces along with ginger paste in curries.

heisenberg747,Question,5,"My local Asian market finally opened back up, so I finally have access to Asian ingredients again. I've always wanted to use Sichuan peppercorns, but I'm not really sure if just dumping some on the food will ruin it or not.

inthrees,Recipe,130,"This works with any kind of pasta - fusilli, penne, macaroni, angel hair, spaghetti, whatever. You can buy it in bulk, store brand, for pretty good prices, especially when it's on sale. Stock up if it goes on sale.

Then you want deli American cheese, not the prepackaged stuff. Yes it matters, because yes it's different. (And better!)

Salt the water and boil the pasta according to directions. I like mine on the firmer side so when the box says ""cooks in 10-12 minutes"" I pull it at 9-10 minutes. If it says 5-6 minutes (like angel hair) I pull it at 4 minutes or so, if the noodles are really pliable when I stir them. (Side note, most directions vastly overstate the amount of water you need. In general you want the pasta completely covered with at least an inch of water on top of it. You don't have to wait the 20 minutes it takes to boil four quarts of water for a box of spaghetti noodles. Use a large sauce pan and break them in half and then apply gentle pressure until they soften and are submerged, for example.)

Drain into a colander but don't do a good job of it - you want some of that salted water in reserve, probably 2-3 tablespoons per serving you're cooking. Alternately you can just ladel some into a cup or bowl right before you strain the noodles. 

Put the noodles back in the pot with the water you saved (or that you didn't pour out) and and add 2-3 slices of cheese per serving, ripped into quarters or halves, and then stir until it's all melted and you can a cheese sauce. This takes approximately a minute or so, if you do it immediately. The residual heat on the noodles and the water you saved (immediately prior to straining) is enough to get the job done. It's that fast.

This doesn't sound like it would be good but it is phenomenal. You can also add grated parmesan or some other cheese if you want to fancy it up, but be aware that many 'harder' cheeses will not melt and emulsify well. Also shaker can parmesan (and anything pre-shredded in a bag) is treated with corn starch, which isn't really a problem for me but might be for some of you. (You want an emulsifier like sodium citrate or even good old mustard powder for some cheese, experiment if you want.)

If you use less water you can add a splash of milk, but it's not required.

Add salt and pepper, garlic, oregano or basil if you want. I sometimes add in a spoonful of basil pesto for a completely different experience.

You can get American cheese from the deli for $4-$6 per pound in most markets I'd imagine, or $8-$9 per pound for Boar's Head. I've never really counted slices but this is enough cheese for a good number of batches. It's a little more expensive than the prepackaged stuff but that's because it's actual cheese and not 'cheese product'. It's worth it. You can also use it on sandwiches and melts.

If no one watches you make this, they'll have no idea what you did and will assume you are a wizard, when in fact you got the idea from the cookingforbeginners subreddit.

PoppaSquatt2010,Recipe,16,"Roux. What is it? It’s likely the base of every thick and delicious soup, stew or sauce you’ve ever had. Basically all you need is a liquid fat (typically melted butter) and some starch (typically flour). 

Heat your butter in a pan on a lower to medium heat (butter will brown quickly if not careful!) Throw in some flour while you’re whisking heavily. Typically a traditional roux will call for a 1:1 ratio of starch to fat but I find this to be a bit heavy for most applications. If making something lighter like Alfredo and many other sauces, I use a 1:2 ratio or even 1:3. Eventually you can just eyeball it. Then once it’s mixed together and simmering, you have a roux! 

The more you cook it the darker it will get. This will also start changing the flavor. Don’t be afraid if it looks too thick like a paste, we will get to that next. After you have your desired color and thickness cut it with milk, broth, sherry, wine, all kinds of liquids to make your desired sauce or soup. This can be tough to get right if the roux is really thick but add a little at a time and whisk heavily until blended then add some more and repeat!

For an easy gravy, make a roux and whisk in your broth of choice while simmering. Bonus points if you cook your onion and garlic in the butter first before adding the flour to thicken.

Natuanas,,5,"The first thing Google told me was, I didn't have to do a thing, outside the fridge peanut butter would last well into 3-4 months. In a youtube video I had another story.

I took polish off as wash off, but since I'm not sure if that's the indended meaning, I come here.

For clarity, these were the narrator's exact words: There is one caveat here when it comes to refrigeration, though: If you're not going to polish off that jar of natural peanut butter within a month, it needs to be stored in the fridge to prevent it from going rancid.

houseplanthelp,Question,8,"A few years ago my ex and I went out to a ramen shop. We have several in town and she can't remember which one it was or else I'd know more about it. I got some kind of really good chicken ramen and got it pretty spicy. I can't remember all the toppings it had, but it had some kind crispy, breaded chicken (kind of like strips of it??) and the clear kind of broth. [It looked a lot like this ramen, actually!](https://imgur.com/gallery/IcC2o) It had veggies and other toppings and it was divine. Today we've had some freaky cold weather and it's making me crave a bowl of fancy ramen. I have no idea how to garnish it or whatever.

  
Growing up, I ate a lot of Maruchan and Top ramen and it quickly became a comfort food. I went through a period where I couldn't eat it because I was living off of it, but then I found sriracha sauce and fell back in love with ramen. I used to 'doctor it up with some soy sauce' and sriracha and would occasionally do that thing where you stir in an egg right after you dump in your seasoning packet so you have strings of egg in your broth but have never tried to make fancy ramen before.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went grocery shopping I got a 4 pack of this Shin Black spicy ramen, some individual packets of Sapporo Ichiban ramen and some ramen in a brand called Sunny Maid that happens to be vegetarian. I've never tried these before but thought it might be a nice change from the Maruchan that I've been buying. I found a small carton of this Japanese inspired Ramen soy ginger chicken broth and have a carton of chicken broth too, just plain chicken broth.

&amp;#x200B;

I got some sliced mushrooms and green onion and a carton of extra large eggs (they were out of large :/) and have some sesame oil but have no idea what else would make good toppings...or whatever you call them. The problem I'm running into (other than the broth thing, there are so many types out there apparently) is not knowing how to cook the meat to put on the ramen to be extra fancy and make it a more filling meal. I feel like ham would be fine with pork ramen but don't know how to cook the chicken to be breaded and crunchy like it was at the ramen shop. I'd like to be able to cook fancy ramen as a decently cheap meal since cold weather is coming, but I'm also only cooking for myself right now. 

What's the best kind of egg to put in ramen(as in the way you cook it)? I dislike hard boiled because the yolk sucks.

SPOOKY-chair,Question,37,"So for the past few months, I’ve been losing weight and it seems I’ve been having troubles stomaching a lot of foods. I believe this is related to stress, mental health, and my meds.

So I’ve never been a picky eater, I will eat most things- but lately I feel like my stomach can’t handle anything (nauseated feeling). But one thing I can stomach is microwave nachos. Just through some tostitos in with some cheddar cheese and microwave that bitch. However, the more I eat them the more I feel like I can ONLY eat them. 1-2 times a day I eat them. I think this is because they’re high fat and don’t have much taste. My friends and roommate have sat me down and said I eat them too much and they’re somewhat worried about me. Like I know  it’s bad for me, but I love them so much

So, me being a terrible cook who has issues eating food. What are some relatively palatable recipes that I can make to substituted for nachos (low taste, higher cal, easy and fast to get down)?

tdstooksbury,Question,2,"Hi all,

We’re visiting some friends tomorrow for Labor Day. We’ve been asked to bring a potato dish. I found a recipe for a loaded baked potato casserole. They said I can finish it in their oven.

It involves baking 6 potatoes, slicing them up and putting them in a baking dish and layering it with cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, butter, etc, and then finishing it in the oven.

We are going over there at 1. Is it possible I can bake and slice the potatoes at home, bring them in the dish and then finish it off at their house at like 5pm. Do I need to refrigerate the potatoes for the 4 hours before I add the fixings and cook it?

flubbinit,Question,66,"I'm starting to get the hang of cooking, and I branch out a lot with trying cookbooks and pinterest recipes. I'm a decent enough cook now that they usually come out pretty okay, technically anyway. Some better than others, usually not bad per se. I'm starting to understand the theory of recipes and how flavors work together, and no matter how much butter or salt or other spices I try to add, I'm now thinking everything misses the mark for me because my partner's number one no-no food is onions (and shallots and scallions)-- HATES them, can tell they're in there no matter how ground up, there's no 'sneaking it in' like for a picky toddler, so I just leave them out when they're called for. I don't judge him for it-- I don't do anything with ginger and a couple other flavors, everybody's got a thing they hate. I'm not offended that I have to work around this, I just grew up with a very onion-heavy palate and now I'm starting to notice the missing oomph in a lot of meals that would usually call for them, and they're in so many recipes.

What is a similarly robust and flavorful staple that goes with practically everything that I could add to recipes in place of onions to make things just a little deeper and richer, if you feel me? I feel so pretentious trying to describe flavors but hopefully you get what I mean. Could be a spice, or some other kind of vegetable-- one not in the onion family.

Obeisance8,Question,11,"Hi,
Before my wife I couldn't cook at all. But together I leaned the basics and we cook together all the time.

One of the first things I learned to cook was meat, mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. She loves fish, I don't like seafood. I experimented with different fish until I found one with a taste/texture I could tolerate.

So we have a ""traditional meal"" that says we care. Salmon, mashed potatoes and corn.

What's yours?

...

My wife is having a tough time at work right now and I have Friday off. So I want to surprise her with something. My default is what I mentioned, which she will always love.

I'm posting this, looking for inspiration. Something different? We eat a lot of slow cooker meals, curry, pasta, Mexican, etc.

Problem is, heaps of food intolerances. Gluten, soy, basil, peas, garlic, onion (think FODMAP+) and very small amounts of chill. We use infused garlic oil and leek over onion.

ImParticleMan,Question,12,"I've been honing my chicken game and feel it's going well. My current strategy is use only fresh breasts (not pre-frozen), let temp come up close to room temp (sit out for about 20 min), tenderize to an even flat breast (shoot for \~.75""-1"" thickness), season with just crushed salt and pepper. Heat pan to med-high (6.5 on dial of 1-9), then add some light EVOO for sauteing/frying. One oil is to temp, add chicken.

deathcovers123,Question,6,"TL/DR: is it normal for fat to come out of a meat grinder [like a paste?](https://imgur.com/a/pqV1QIH) ^((the lesser known Madonna hit))

I got a meat grinder last week and started using it. Made some passable burgers the other day.

When I went to the butchers I asked for the meat and also for fat trimmings. He gave me about 1.5 pounds of fat, which was way more than what I needed for my first batch, so I decided to grind it and freeze it for future batches.

I cut the fat into very small cubes and froze them for about 90 minutes, but I forgot to chill the parts of the grinder. It all went through with very little resistance and barely any of it stuck to the inside, but it’s just a mushy paste (see pic above)

Is that normal? I know the meat is supposed to be minced, not mushed, but I’m not sure about the fat. Will it be ok to blend with ground meat for a nice burger?

Thanks in advance.",cookingforbeginners,Ground fat coming out as paste?,1598833478,6,170,"Ground fat coming out as paste? TL/DR: is it normal for fat to come out of a meat grinder [like a paste?](https://imgur.com/a/pqV1QIH) ^((the lesser known Madonna hit))

I want to fry pork boston butt like [this](https://i.imgur.com/lWEqXG5.jpg).

I want to do it simple, without any marinating etc.

I'm  a newbie when it comes to cooking meat, so for now, I just want to know  how can I cook meat so it doesn't end up raw and won't make me sick.  Taste is the last concern really.

I want to fry it with lard.

Could  you please give me the simplest instruction as possible (kind of like  ELI5) how should I do it? Or maybe it's not doable with my poor  equipment?

1. Should I leave the meat and wait until it gets a room temperature or can I put a cold piece of meat on a pan?
2. Should I use meat mallet and make it flat? How thick/thin should the meat be?
3. Can I cook the meat if there is a slight appearance of blood?
4. Should  I fry it on high heat, medium or low? How long per side should I fry  it? Should I fry it only once per each side or turn it few times when  cooking?
5. Should I put a lid on a pan or can I do it without a lid?
6. Should I add water so the meat won't burn?

MartiMa08,Recipe,16,"I decided to make a chickpea curry for dinner with rice, I’ve never even cooked rice other than microwave packet ones before here’s what did and did not go well:

The bad:

When I opened the bag of rice it split and went everywhere.

A lot of my rice stuck to the bottom of the pan (not enough water??)

I burned myself (not too badly.)

The tinned chickpeas had no instructions which worried me a tad.

I thought I had hardly any rice but turned into about double what I would have liked.

I wanted to add lemon juice but forgot.

Spilled the curry part everywhere when transferring the excess to a container.

I have a butt load to clean up.

I now have to eat the rest tomorrow..

What went well:

The rice was cooked! I did end up leaving it on a bit longer than it said to though.

The sauce actually tasted quite nice - chickpeas I’ve never had before other than hummus but they’re okay I guess.

I experimented and hopefully haven’t poisoned myself.

I have dinner sorted for tomorrow (I will a microwave rice again I think!)

I actually quite enjoyed it and I am proud of myself for giving it a shot!

If anyone is interested in what I done for the curry:

Butter and frozen chopped onions, added chopped garlic from a jar.

Tin of chopped tomatoes.

Added: curry powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder.

Added in my chickpeas.

AGDude,Recipe,2,"Description:

This  tastes like like a sort of spicy, cheesy corn chowder.  I admit that this was not at all what I expected when I cooked it.

Spots of cheese harden onto your spoon as you eat it.

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients:

* 1 16 oz can Old El Paso traditional refried beans
* 1 teaspoon Chicken Better than Bouillon
* 1 cup water
* 1 can corn, drained
* Spices (A taco seasoning packet is probably fine.  Personally, I used Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Chili powder, Cumin, and red pepper flakes)
* 8 oz Mexican cheese blend

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions:

1. Combine all ingredients except cheese in a pot.
2. Bring to a boil on medium heat, mixing continuously.
3. Add cheese.  Reduce heat to simmer.  Continue cooking/mixing for 3 more minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* Your choice of refried beans makes a difference.  If your refried beans don't include a fat (e.g., lard), you may need to adjust the recipe.
* My first attempt at this recipe combined all ingredients including cheese and cooked on high heat until bubbling.  This worked and was tasty, but also burned some cheese onto the pan.  The above variation probably prevents this, but is untested.

Nobody ever taught me how to cook and now that I’m searching online, I just don’t know where to look. I guess I have a few questions...

1. How can I best cook chicken, turkey and fish? I want to stick to these two and wondering if the oven is okay. If so, what’s the recommended temp for them? 

2. What are some good spices to season them and veggies with? 

3. Do you have any videos or books or links that can teach me how to season or cook veggies?

I usually have done frozen but I don’t know... it feels pretty bland since I didn’t even add pepper or salt. 

4. HOW do I season them? What’s the process? Mix the spices in a bowl and dip the meat and veggies in them? 


5. Would roasting make the veggies tastier?

Mroder1,Question,5,"So I made pasta sauce today, second time doing it, first time I used canned San marzano tomatoes 1 yellow onion 1 head of oven-roasted garlic, basil oregano and a little olive oil.

So I saw a sale on Roma tomatoes. Bought about 5 pounds of those. Then I added 2 yellow onions 2 heads of chopped garlic basil and oregano and a little olive oil. 

The second time I made this it came out really sweet, like I had added a bunch of sugar to it, but I didn’t! Why? I understand that pasta sauce sweetens as you stew it, that’s why they add sugar to the jarred versions, to simulate long stewing. 

There were only a few variables that changed so which one was it and how can I combat it?

-Glooma-,Question,15,"I had bought these chicken thighs to fry (only with olive oil nothing else added) when I start cooking meat I start on the lowest heat, so i added the chicken to the pan and cooked it on low flipping the peices over every so often to prevent burning. (The thighs were 4 oz thick each)

 I check the internal temperature and it was at 70 still, (after 15 minutes of cooking) and it was also starting to brown and get crispy so I tried to turn up the heat, but the oil cooked aggressively and It popped on me so I lowered the fire  back down to where I had it initially. Time passes and the internal temperature is still low, so I then sliced the chicken (not all the way) to allow for heat to cook it internally more. Time passed (already almost 30 and more minutes) and i was still flipping it often as I can to prevent burning. It was very crispy and brown and on the verge of burning. 

Still the internal temperature was only 100... so I think...ok.. ill just shred the chicken as it is and cook it like that. So I cook it for another 3 minutes shredded in the pan and the internal temperature was still 110 or so... it was almost burt. Smh I was so fustrated at this point. I ate it anyways because I wasn't wanting to waste it and end up burning it. 

But now... im scared of food poisoning. Should I be concerned? Why did this happen? What did I do wrong and how can I prevent this from happening again?

chipschipschipss,Recipe,16,"Hi everyone! I started doing this new thing every week that has really helped my food budget and also my pre-dinner stress that comes with questions like ""what am i going to make for dinner tonight?"" and ""what do i even have to make dinner anyways?"", so I thought I would share. 

It's nothing revolutionary, but every Sunday, my partner and I will find some recipes we want to make for the week and we plan ahead like that. Then, we go grocery shopping based on what we're eating this week and it has made it SO much easier and has saved us a lot of money since we know exactly what we're getting and don't have to go out every few days because we forgot something. For example, we used to spend $75-80 a week and now it's closer to $35-45.

So, for example, the list will look something like this:

Monday: One pot cilantro ground turkey and rice (really good, I'd be happy to link the recipe)

Tuesday: Pesto Salmon and Roasted Veggies (happy to let you all know how i made the salmon and roasted the garlic)

Wednesday: Chicken curry meatballs with rice (also delicious, recipe here: [https://whiteonricecouple.com/recipes/thai-curry-chicken-meatballs/](https://whiteonricecouple.com/recipes/thai-curry-chicken-meatballs/))

Thursday: Stewed veggies with roasted sausage 

Friday: Oven roasted chicken with zucchini and couscous

Sometimes, we'll do breakfast for dinner or have a leftover night if we don't eat it for lunch but its a really efficient way to shop and a great way to try new recipes. I'll also look for recipes that have ingredients that I already had (I had pesto, so I just had to buy salmon) or swap some ingredients out for things I already have (for monday, we had ground turkey i wanted to use up so i used that instead of the chicken the recipe called for). I also really like roasting things because its so freaking easy and requires very little effort. We also have a staple meal that never changes and thats the stewed veggies with sausage and thats really only because i fucking love stewed veggies with sausage.

nbachickenlover,Question,8,"I try to make a mixed-vegetable curry of sorts in a stainless steel pot. I add all the ingredients and let it simmer on medium-high heat for a while. The reason I leave it on there for so long is because I have potatoes in there that I would like to cook in the curry (although they are pre-cooked in a microwave until they're a little softer). Admittedly, I don't stir the mixture very often.

I still end up getting a decent product at the end, but I'm left with having to scrub [this](https://imgur.com/a/iHIHvKi) every time.

How can I prevent this? Based on things I read from other posts, I need to try the following:

 - Keep adding water so that it doesn't all boil away and raise the heat of the mixture too much.
 - Lower the heat even further? I already did lower it from high to medium-high with no different results.
 - Keep stirring the ingredients while scraping the bottom. I was hoping to be able to let it simmer for a while without having to attend to it, but if it's something that I must do, then I shall do it.

Is there anything else I could be doing wrong? Would it help to leave the lid on the pot for a while, at least until the potatoes cook, or will that make the curry to watery?

Abood1es,Question,21,"So I am back in dorms after spending a long time at my parents’ for quarantine, and I’ve gotten so used to eating freshly cooked food there that I can’t bear to eat junk here. I’ve been buying ready cooked healthy meals but the cost is adding up quickly and I wanna start making my own food.


In my dorms were not allowed to have gas appliances, but we have an electric stove. However I absolutely can’t use electric and so I currently just microwave everything. I’m looking at appliances and I’m just not sure what they’re used for or how they’re different.... pressure cookers? Air fryers? Electric toaster ovens?


I’m looking for something I can use to cook chicken and fish with, sometimes steak maybe, and also make roasted vegetables. But maybe something versatile enough that they’re not the only thing I can make with it. Preferably something that doesn’t require too much oil added and something that can cook my meal quickly in 20 mins or so.

42DaisyPusher,Question,37,"So I have been a pretty avid cook most of my adulthood. I’m Cajun and tend to cook Cajun style food, meaning big pots of spicy comfort food that you eat over rice, but I’ve been modifying traditional recipes to be vegetarian or vegan for years. I’ve also been improvising in the kitchen using some of the Mennonite principles I learned from the More With Less cookbook, making basic southern style food using inexpensive pantry basics to make wholesome, tasty food. My husband, my 8yo and I usually enjoy the food. My 6yo won’t even taste it. 

My 6yo has always been interested in the kitchen, and she’s just become a really good assistant, but even if she is involved in the process from the very beginning, she will not taste even the sauce part of what we make. She’ll eat biscuits or cornbread, or she might pick out a piece of sausage (which was a huge leap forward), but she will not even lick a spoon with the stew on it. She will say it smells good, and that I make the best recipes, but I can’t get her to try it. 

She has some sensory processing stuff, mainly with textures. When she was probably 3 or so, she would try the stuff we would work on in the kitchen (she would peel garlic for me and pour stuff into pots) her face would light up, then she would chew a few times and then just spit the food out on the table and shudder with a look on her face like it was torment. She might have loved the flavor, but she couldn’t have it in her mouth. She can’t tolerate things like apple pie (wet bread, weird fruit, and a slimy sauce), and vegetables and fruits, whether cooked or raw, are completely hit or miss. She doesn’t eat a lot of normal kid foods like grilled cheese. She actually eats fewer items now than she did two years ago. If we serve her a fruit and it’s not good (for example, we got a batch of sour blackberries a while back) she might never eat that fruit again. 

So if anyone has advice I am all ears. If you are on the spectrum and learning to cook, I’d love to hear from you, if you know of simple recipes that have good nutrition but simple textures I’d love to hear from you, if you have experience cooking for super picky kids I’d love to hear from you.

Incogcneat-o,Recipe,24,"*I see this question all the time, so I thought I'd make a post. I live in a foodie paradise in Mexico but was raised in the US by a family who lived 30 years in various parts of Asia. I have eaten a LOT of rice. This is not the technique I learned in my snooty French culinary school, but one cobbled together from SE Asia, the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, Latin America, and the American South.* 

*It is infinitely adaptable in flavor and scale. This technique works whether you want a flavorful rice to eat with Thai, Mexican, Indian, Soul Food or whatever else you can imagine. Swap ingredients in and out as the spirit moves you. Have a tried and true method you adore? Keep using that one. For anyone else: Give this one a shot.*

# HOW TO MAKE ""THAT GOOD RICE""

&amp;#x200B;

* **Put some oil in your pan** and put it on medium heat.
   * How much oil? Some, and then a little bit more.
   * What type of oil?  Who cares. Not motor oil tho.
* **Measure out some rice.**
* **Measure twice as much water as rice by volume** into a kettle to boil.
   * You can substitute some, but not all, of the water with coconut milk, white wine, fish sauce, or broth
   * If you're American trash like me who didn't get a kettle until they were an adult you can microwave it as long as you promise to feel bad about it.
* **Chop up some sturdy aromatics and saute them in your pot**
   * Garlic, onions, ginger, or whatever sturdy aromatics you like. However much you want in whatever combination you want.
   * Want to throw a chile or two in there? Some cumin seeds? Cardamom? Why not. This rice is not the king of you.
   * Leave the dried stuff and the delicate stuff until later. We'll get there.
* **Dump your rice in that bitch and stir** until it's glossy with oil.
   * Not lubed up enough? Add some more oil. Who's gonna tell?
* **Toast your rice**, stirring whenever you think of it, until it's opaque and dull
   * If you want to toast it past that, go for it. Rice toasted to a light golden brown is my fave.
* **Add salt** or bouillon powder, plus any dried or powdered spices, to your rice.
   * Rice takes more salt than you'd think, but also it's easier to add salt than remove it so add a bunch, but not a whole bunch. Cooking!
   * You can also add sturdy fresh herbs now like sage leaves or sprigs of rosemary. You shouldn't because it sounds gross, but hey, it's your funeral.
* **Stir in the boiling water** into the rice.
   * Scrape up any of the burnt bits on the bottom because that's called fond and it has a ton of flavor.
* **Drop the heat** to the lowest setting and **COVER. YO. POT**.
* Check for doneness after **11 minutes**
   * Will it be done after 11 minutes? Probably not, but don't check it any earlier than that.
   * It should be firm but not have any snap in the middle. If it's still chalky tasting inside, keep it on the heat, checking it every two minutes.
   * Try to not let too much steam escape
* **Kill the heat, add your fresh herbs, and COVER. YO. POT for another 10 minutes.**
   * Diced green onion and cilantro stems are 100 but I won't judge you if you throw some small frozen veg in there.
   * WHEW, you're in the homestretch now! Deep breath!
* **Remove the lid and fluff the rice WITH A FORK** and let it sit for another 10.
   * Yes, it has to be a fork (or chopsticks) or else you wont get nice grains. You are beloved and deserve unclumpy rice.
* **Your rice is ready!** Technically!
   * I like to let it sit uncovered at least 20 minutes for best texture, fluffing whenever I think of it.
   * Add whatever toppings you like --I like any variation of cilantro, toasted sesame seeds, minced ginger, chopped radish and quickly pickled shredded carrot-- a drizzle of toasted sesame seed oil if it sounds good, and go to town.

* 2 Tbsp of Honey = 128 Calories &amp; 42 grams
* 2 Tbsp of Almond Milk = 8 Calories &amp; 30 grams
* 5 bananas = 605 Calories &amp; 680 grams

This comes out to a total of 732 Calories &amp; 752 grams. So 100 grams of this nice cream would be around 100 Calories, less than half the standard vanilla ice cream!

tedteo,Recipe,1,"How To Make Strawberry Jam (3 Ingredients)

You will need:

2 lbs (or 900g) of fresh strawberries

7 Oz (or 200g) of granulated sugar

1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice

Steps:

To make this recipe at home:

1) Remove the top of the strawberries and roughly chop each strawberry into smaller pieces. You don’t have to be neat here. Go ahead and make it rustic

2) Add the lemon juice into the strawberries. Make sure you remove any seeds that may end up in the bowl. The lemon juice not only helps by mellowing the overall sweetness of the jam, it also helps activate the pectins in the strawberry which is what gives jam its thick consistency.

3) Add the sugar to the strawberries. Mix well and allow to macerate for one hour. This helps break down the fruit and pulls out the liquid that helps dissolve the sugar.

4) Add the strawberry mixture into a small pot, making sure that there is enough room in the pot such that it will not overboil. Heat the strawberry mixture over medium heat.

5) Make sure you do not walk away and do not let the jam burn. Stir and scrap the bottom of the pot constantly. Once the jam is bubbling, lower the heat to medium. Remove any foam that appears at the top of the pot.

6) Put a plate into the freezer for at least 10 minutes. Next, remove the plate from the freezer and add a teaspoon worth of jam to the plate and gently spread it around. When the jam has cooled, run your finger through the jam and gently share the plate. If the mark you left with your finger in the jam holds firm, your jam is ready.

7) Before you bottle your jam, sterilise your jar. Preheat your oven to 160 Degrees Celcius or 320 Degrees Fahrenheit. Wash the jar and the lid in hot soapy water but don’t dry them. Place the Jar and the lid into the oven for 15 minutes. Take the jar and lid out of the oven and allow to cool. 

8) You can now start bottling the strawberry jam. Use a funnel if you have one. Be careful as the strawberry jam may still be very hot.

My question is, how do I cook this without drying it out now and making it tender? Should I leave it whole and cut after cooking? Should I cut into bite size then sear each piece and then put in stew? How long do I cook?

How can I save this beef stew using this cut of meat?"

I love BLT's.  Let's face it, it's simple, it's tasty, and it involves bacon.
I've eaten BLT's is a few different countries, even had one that substituted monkey for pork, and it was actually pretty good. But, the best BLT's I've ever had were in the American south, using bacon offcuts, however, that's not the trick, regular bacon is fine. Its your basic BLT, bacon, lettuce, tomato, bread, and mayo. Toasted or not?  Either, depending on you.  However, try this.  Toast 2 pieces of bread in the toaster, face to face. Put the mayo on the untoasted sides, built your sandwich, salt and pepper if you wish. You will end up with a BLT that isn't too soggy by the end, or that falls apart when you bite into it.  Delish.

CaptainNiglo,Question,4,"Hey guys,

today I wanted to try out a new snack and I'm really in the mood for a bowl of popcorn. I found a recipe in which you just heat some butter over medium high heat, add sugar, wait until the sugar is incorporated into the butter and then add the corn and wait. However, I have a few questions. 1)How do I maximize the amount of corn popped and 2) Can I use maple syrup instead of sugar? Does it work/taste just as good? Cause im a real sucker for maple syrup but the only recipes I found add the maple syrup afterwards and bake the popcorn in the oven, which I do not want to do.

AwkwardBubble19,Question,1,"Hey folks, I'm kinda new to the culinary scene, and so far I've been having a lot of success cooking fish. Over the past few years, though, the one thing I've consistently noticed is that store bought, frozen catfish is absolutely disgusting. I've tried frying it, oven baking it with some spices, even grilling it, but it's always tasted pretty terrible no matter what. I should say, I don't think that catfish is a bad fish for eating, I know well enough that fresh, self caught catfish tends to be pretty good if you clean it right. However, I just haven't found a way to enjoy store bought catfish. This leads me to a few major questions.

rorienicole,Question,13,"I want to sustain a clean eating way of life, or shall I say MORE of a clean eating way of life (not diet) because I'm sick of feeling BLAH and want nourishing foods going into my body but the thing that has been against me and fails me time and time again is the fact that I HATE COOKING, meal prepping, all that jazz. I understand there has to be an effort to do those things to get where I want to be but there has to be an ultimate place for beginners to start. For example, I want SIMPLE and EASY recipes. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

But every time I google simple or easy clean recipes, I never find what I am looking for. I guess other people's ""simple and easy"" is a recipe that calls for 10-15 items that include obscure different ingredients, and takes 2-3 different cooking methods to make the meal come together ( start to boil this, while you are frying this at the same time while mixing together that). I know that is what cooking is, but you feel me right? I want to get something SIMPLE and EASY down first that can become HABIT for me before I start following interesting and unique recipes that look super good and would love to try but the stage I am at right now looking at recipes makes me dizzy and I end up caving in and do what I always do. Frozen meals here, take out there, with smoothie recipes on the side, sourdough bread with jam for breakfast to fill me up.

One time I paid a woman $30 on this website called FIVERR to create a clean meal plan for me and silly me I thought it would be tailored to what I was experiencing but I have a feeling it was just a template meal plan she gives everyone- a general clean eating meal plan.

RDBRULZ,Question,27,"It feels like it's every day that I see a post on here asking for advice on how to shop for groceries and I kind of feel like there should be a general post for it that gets shared where everyone can pitch in their advice so hopefully users can find it with a search or be easily linked it if it comes up.  So here is my two cents on the matter.

* Shopping isn't one size fits all, find what works for you with trial and error
* Food waste will happen, don't feel like you're failing when it does. Try to incorporate excess into other meals when possible or just buy as much as you need
* How often can you shop and how accessible are the shopping locations? This should affect if you are buying fresh or shelf stable and the quantity you buy
* If you are just starting out, try to buy just what you need for the recipe you are attempting
* If you have a number of recipes that you like to make regularly, keep the shelf stable staples of those recipes stocked and try to buy them when they go on sale to stock up
* Don't be turned off from dishes that require a large number of hard to find or new to you ingredients, there are often simpler versions of those recipes you can find with a quick bit of google searching
* Build your spice/seasoning/sauce/oil/vinegar/salt selection as you try recipes. Don't go out and buy a big spice rack, chances are the spices are old and more than half of them you will likely not use. If you find that you keep using a particular spice then start buying it in bulk. Use a mix often? Try making it yourself, it can often be cheaper and better quality.
* To save money, keep track of all of your typical pantry staples and whenever you go shopping for other items keep an eye out for those items when they are on sale. Keeping your pantry and spice cabinet stocked with basics really opens up the number of dishes that you can make quickly and easily.
* Bulk deals can be tempting, but they really only make sense if you are actually going to be able to eat it all before it spoils. Remember that many items can be frozen for long term storage.


Here is my process for grocery shopping. I use an app called ""Flipp"" that allows me to make a grocery list and each item on that list gets cross checked against all my local grocery stores weekly flyers. As I'm going about my day, if I use something up, I'll add it to my list. For example, I just used up the last of my lemon juice, so I immediately added it into the list and next time I'm shopping I'll look for it. I shop flexibly, not really on a set schedule. Any time I need to go to the store for something specific I need for a planned meal, I use that as an opportunity to pick up anything that I'm low on.

So I will:

* 1. Identify a recipe I want to make
* 2. Identify the ingredients I need to pick up for the recipe
* 3. Add them to my grocery list and check for sales
* 4. Go to grocery store and pick up the items I need, plus anything else on sale that I could use
* 5. Properly store and divide things up as soon as I get home




In terms of saving money while shopping I can offer some more advice. First of all, compare quality/quantity/weight and not just price. Products often come in different sizes and qualities and even though something is cheaper at one store, it might not necessarily be the same product or same amount.

Pre-packaged fresh foods like vegetable platters and salads often cost way more than what it would be to prepare it for yourself. If your goal is to just feed yourself and you don't have time then I think they are an option, if you want to prepare your own food then buy the component ingredients and assemble them yourself. The quality will often be better and it will be a better value.

Keep tabs on your most expensive food items and take advantage of sales and your freezer whenever you can. My most expensive items are meat (often chicken or beef in varying forms), butter, and cheese. All three of these things freeze really well. And sales on them can often be found where you can bulk up. This has the possibility of cutting down your food bills dramatically and also ensuring you have major components available after a thaw for upcoming dishes.

Different stores are often better at certain things, or give better deals on certain things. In my town there are four different grocery stores that I have quick access to and a farmers market. Depending on what I'm buying, I might selectively shop in one place over the other based on quality and price and how local the food production was.  You'll get a feel for what stores are better at what when you are more experienced.

Different items might also come in different forms and the price could be considerably different. I like to cook with beans, you can buy them canned or dried and while dried is less convenient for preparation (often requiring a soak overnight and longer cooking times) they are considerably cheaper and store for longer with less weight and space.

Always be wary of bulk deals, unless it's something that you use regularly and won't expire quickly then is it really a good value if half of it goes into the garbage?

babyyhiccups,Question,5,"Last night I steamed about 2-3 lbs of Snow Crab and the leftovers I put in a dish, and covered the top, sealed tight with aluminum foil to store them in the fridge but one (possible) problem...

I raced home, and I do not know how cold that fridge is, but I know the water that is stored in there is cool, not room temp, not cold, just barely cool. Exactly like most cold tap/fridge water.

I transferred them to the freezer part of that same fridge which is not a legit freezer but is colder than any fridge, will they still be safe to eat tomorrow?

Fresh4,Question,8,"I recently got a pasta roller and have been enjoying making fresh egg/flour pasta and was just wondering a couple things based on my limited experience/failures. 

I know it doesn’t take much time at all to cook fresh pasta in boiling water (does it have to be violently boiling or is a frequent bubbling okay?), and I know it depends on the thickness of the pasta but is there a rule of thumb for doneness? Like when it floats, do I take it out? It takes like 5-10 seconds for it to float the last few times I’ve tried and I doubted that it was enough so I left it in for maybe too long (like two minutes? Pasta was a ‘7’ out of 9 thin on the roller) and the water started to foam and the noodles were a bit slimy/goopy when I mixed them with the sauce. 

Any tips would be great, and I’m also open to some easy but not too heavy sauce recipes.

dodbogi,Video,0,"Japchae or chapchae (잡채) is a very popular Korean dish. It is the number one sought after dish particularly during the Korean festive holidays (e.g. New Year’s day and Harvest festival) but it is also enjoyed on any other common day as well.

wants_to_learn_more,Question,40,"The common advice for getting a good sear on a steak is to get your heaviest pan and get it as hot as you can. My heaviest pan is my fully clad stainless steel pan (zwilling sensation).

The problem is that if I take my shiny and clean pan and sear a steak in it, it gets all messed up and I need to spend 15 minutes scrubbing the burnt oil with barkeeper's friend to get it back to the state it was in before I seared the steak.

[For reference, here's how the pan looks like after searing a steak and washing with sponge and soap](https://postimg.cc/Z0ykhxH9)

My guess is that the bottom is not as hot as a lot of that heat goes into the food, but the sides get hot af and stay that way, so any oil splatter that ends up on the walls, immediately burns in.

Is this simply the price of getting a well seared steak? Or am I doing something wrong? I tried using avocado oil because it apparently has a higher smoke point, but I didn't notice a difference between avocado an canola oil.

The only things that seem to alleviate this problem:

* Use a lower temperature. This doesn't seem to get as good of a sear, or you get a really big doneness gradient in the steak.
* Put more stuff in the pan. Having more stuff in the pan reduces the temperature, and reduces the room for oil to splatter on the walls which is where the oil burns. But usually I just have one steak to make, not 2-3. Perhaps a smaller pan is the answer (mine is 28cm/11in)?",cookingforbeginners,Stainless steel pan messed up every time after searing a steak - anything I can do about it?,1596364946,18,273,"Stainless steel pan messed up every time after searing a steak - anything I can do about it?

tedteo,Recipe,45,"How To Make Chocolate Truffles With Only 2 Ingredients!

You will need:

240g of Condensed Milk

100g of Cocoa Powder

Steps:

To make this recipe at home:

1) Open a can of condensed milk and measure out 240g of condensed milk

2) Next, measure out 100g of cocoa powder

3) Heat the condensed milk in a microwave for 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can heat it in a small pot of a gentle flame (but make sure you stir constantly as the condensed milk will burn very quickly)

4) Introduce the cocoa powder into the condensed milk in 3 separate batches. Each time you do, pass it through a sieve to remove any lumps. Mix until well combined before adding the next batch of cocoa powder.

5) Line some cling wrap in a container and press it down such that the cling wrap adheres to the container.

6) In small batches, spoon the chocolate mixture into the container and even it out as you go along. Next fold the plastic wrap and cover the chocolate mixture and leave it in the fridge for 2 hours.

7) After 2 hours, take the chocolate mixture out of the fridge.

8) Sprinkle some cocoa powder over a clean surface. Remove the chocolate mixture out of the cling wrap and place it on the cocoa powder.

9) Dust more cocoa powder over the top of the chocolate mixture.

10) Grab a sharp knife and make some indentations over the chocolate mixture to mark out how many chocolate truffles pieces you would like. Next cut along the lines you have made.

11) To sharp the chocolate truffle, place the chocolate truffle on your palm and gently pinch the sides with your fingers. Repeat till you are done with all pieces.

eaglessoar,Recipe,18,"I wrote this up as a comment and figured I'd just make it as a post here:  

heres 4 super simple recipes i cook every week:

pasta with protein/veggies:  
* boil water put in pasta when boiling  
* put protein/veggies in pan with oil while pasta is boiling  
* when pasta is done strain and put over protein/veggies, add pasta sauce from a jar  
* mix in sauce nicely over heat so sauce warms up  
* (optional) grate cheese on top

tacos:  
* put protein and onions in pan with oil  
* warm up refried beans in microwave or black beans in a small pot (optionally add onions)  
* cut up tomatoes lettuce (avocado, onion, toppings etc)  
* put em all on a tortilla or just make a taco bowl  
* top with cheese and sauce

tray bake:  
* pre heat oven to 400  
* cut up a bunch of veggies (we usually do: potatoes, squash, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes)  
* throw them in a bowl, cover in oil (sometimes balsamic or other vinegar) and spices (changing spices totally change this dish, can be any flavor profile you desire)  
* put in oven at 400 for 20 (if no potatoes) to 40 minutes  
* throw on a plate and top with some cheese

moroccon eggplants:  
* cube up a couple eggplants  
* throw them in a pan with oil and other chosen veggies  
* absolutely cover in cumin, paprika and tumeric  
* cook in pan until soft and tender (just take a piece out and try and when it tastes done it is)  
* top with feta, optionally serve over/alongside lettuce/spinach

the best part of these is you can do so many variations and you dont need to really know what tastes good ahead of time, you can just alter it next time. squash was a random add to our tray bake one day and it came out wicked good so now squash always goes in. had half a tomato lying around one day and threw it in, it was great.",cookingforbeginners,Four super easy recipes I make weekly with endless variations,1596220396,10,356,"Four super easy recipes I make weekly with endless variations I wrote this up as a comment and figured I'd just make it as a post here:

SparkleFritz,Recipe,38,"We've been having some money troubles cause of everything so our dinners have been...not the greatest. I will normally pick up cheap pasta sauce because while I know you can normally make a ton of it from scratch with ease, sometimes jarred pasta sauce is just the best because you can open it up and it's done. The problem is that jarred pasta sauce always leaves more to be desired so I always try to find a middle ground on sprucing it up but keeping it easy.

While boiling the water I combined the following in a very small pot on medium heat (5), I'll explain how to cut each since it's a little odd:

• 1 tbsp olive oil

• Half a jalapeño

• Half a shallot

• Half a 4oz can of mushroom stems (no sodium added)

• Fourth of a green bell pepper

• 3 garlic cloves

• Salt to taste, I used about a teaspoon

• Half the jar of the canned pasta sauce (8oz is what I used for half a box of pasta)

Cut the jalapeño directly down the stem, take out the seeds, then dice into very small pieces. Half the shallot directly down the stem, then dice into small pieces. Mushroom stems you can leave together or chop as small as you want.  Take the flat side of the green bell pepper and slice off one of its walls, de-seed if any and then chop into small pieces. Combine all of these with the oil for five-ish minutes. Then dice the garlic (or use a garlic press which I highly recommend to everyone), add that in with salt and cook on low (3) while the pasta cooks.

When you have 5 minutes left on your pasta, add the jarred pasta sauce with the rest of the ingredients and stir, still on low, to meld the flavors. Once the pasta is done you can combine.

Each of the ingredients can be put in a bag to use later in other ways. The pasta sauce was a dollar, so 50¢ since I only used half, and each other ingredient was about 25¢ or less once you divide it by how much used. I made enough pasta for three people on only $3 and it was mind-blowingly good.

bama501996,Question,8,"So this is the second time I've tried frying chicken. I looked up some recipes and found what looked like a fairly basic one to start with and it went great the first time.  This time however the crust was somehow both burnt and not crunchy. 

I've been trying to look up what happened and the only real thing I've seen was it could have been cold oil but my thermometer was reading around 350 the whole time. 

The recipe I'm using is basically home made chicken nuggets.  Starting with a deboned breast and cut it into inch or so cubes. Season that and mix. Then it's  all purpose flour then egg wash then back in the flower and drop it in the oil. 

The only thing I did differently this time was I added a little milk to the egg wash and I seasoned the flour with some chili powder. 

I also reused the peanut oil from last time if that matters.  I strained it threw a coffee filter while funneling it back into the bottle.  But the oil is black now so I don't think I'll be able to use it again.  

The actual chicken came out tasting great, juicy and tender I think I over cooked them last time. 

Any tips are appreciated, Thanks.",cookingforbeginners,Can you help me figure out what went wrong with my fried chicken?,1596158311,13,223,"Can you help me figure out what went wrong with my fried chicken?

potentanonymity,Question,6,"So I can cook nice meals when I want to, but I'm about to be a (mature-ish) student, and I'm not currently getting all my 5 a day; I thought, since I'm not really hungry in the mornings, I could hack myself a vegetable smoothie that I could heat and eat like a soup with some bread, for an easy way to get my veg.

I didn't expect it to taste nice at all, it is really just a hot smoothie and not a soup, and **I'm not eating it for pleasure, just convenience and health** \- the reason most people make disgusting smoothies. **I get why you shouldn't make a real soup this way**, making a mirepoix to sweeten the veg, or frying to caramelise something - all good stuff, just not what I'm looking for.

Now, I had planned to (and in future hope to) buy veg specifically for this, and choose veg that at least go well together, even if I'm not getting the most out of them.

Today I just really wanted to try it, so I used what was in my fridge. I blended it all up, put it to heat in a saucepan, and added some chicken stock and East Asian condiments/sauces, just to make it taste like something. **It tasted fine for what it was (a gross health smoothie), just with an extreme bitterness.** 

1- **Will this cook away compeltely if I keep going?** It's reduced a bit since cooking, but still there. It's been about 15 minutes on low.

2 - **Is there a particular vegetable or two that might be the cause**, that I should avoid for this in future? 

3 - Would pouring it into a hot pan create this bitterness by burning it? I put it in a pan on high to speed things up before heating on low, but the pan was already hot when I poured it in, and a little bit of the liquid turned a different colour almost instantly. 

Here are the veg (please, once again, I know it's disgusting, it wasn't meant to be nice, just not bitter. I would be perfectly happy with this flavour without the bitterness in an effort to not waste the veg, and could see a better chosen selection of veg working fine in future if they weren't bitter).

Yes all were properly prepared and washed

* 1 orange pepper (properly gutted)
* 1 carrot (skin on)
* 1 courgette (likely culprit) - skin on
* 1 small onion
* 1 small head of broccoli (likely culprit) - more head than stem, leaves obviously removed

4- **What should I avoid generally in future and what is a safe bet**, if I want minimum cooking time? With the right selections, surely I could get something with no bitterness at all, that I could just heat up and eat? 

Again, I'm not looking for something that tastes nice, just something edible that I can wolf down for the sake of health and speed, seasoning only to make it bearable. I'm perfectly good for cooking regular meals the rest of the day, and usually cook a decent hot meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Hopefully the right place for this

The Backstory:
Ok so, single guy #8566589 who has sailed *well* into adulthood having only ever ‘made’ food using either a microwave or a phone reporting in:

Over the last year I’ve gone from an Obese band BMI aaaall the way down to the middle of my healthy weight band as of this Monday, totalling over a 31kg (68lb) drop. Hooray! I did this on a huge program of self development, exercise, and switching my diet to meal replacement shakes I.e. almost no solid food for *months* 

This was pretty extreme but it got the weight off,  was healthy, sustainable for me, and more importantly, has cleansed my palate and cravings of all the awful processed foods, high sugar and takeaways I used to live on. Great so far!

Now I’m at a healthy weight, I need to develop good eating habits to sustain my weight long term, and the key to this for me i feel, is to stock my kitchen with healthy ingredients (no processed ready meals) and build a repertoire of  good healthy meals that I can cook/prepare myself everyday. Really looking forward to getting into it, but....

TLDR;

Never actually used the kitchen properly. Need advice on some of the most *basic* things you can think of:

What pans/utensils are for what? 

Low heat / high heat? 

Pre-heat the oven?

What do you mean I need to put oil in the pan?

Etc.

Like, if you’re thinking “well everyone’s knows *that* so I’ll post about *this* ” I assure you I’ll need to know *that*.

So If anyone would like to share some good advice or resources for an absolute kitchen simpleton, anything and everything you think for day one, it would be very much appreciated!

Ok so, single guy #8566589 who has sailed *well* into adulthood having only ever ‘made’ food using either a microwave or a phone reporting in:

Over the last year I’ve gone from an Obese band BMI aaaall the way down to the middle of my healthy weight band as of this Monday, totalling over a 31kg (68lb) drop. Hooray! I did this on a huge program of self development, exercise, and switching my diet to meal replacement shakes I.e. almost no solid food for *months* 

This was pretty extreme but it got the weight off,  was healthy, sustainable for me, and more importantly, has cleansed my palate and cravings of all the awful processed foods, high sugar and takeaways I used to live on. Great so far!

Now I’m at a healthy weight, I need to develop good eating habits to sustain my weight long term, and the key to this for me i feel, is to stock my kitchen with healthy ingredients (no processed ready meals) and build a repertoire of  good healthy meals that I can cook/prepare myself everyday. Really looking forward to getting into it, but....

TLDR;

Never actually used the kitchen properly. Need advice on some of the most *basic* things you can think of:

What pans/utensils are for what? 

Low heat / high heat? 

Pre-heat the oven?

What do you mean I need to put oil in the pan?

Etc.

Like, if you’re thinking “well everyone’s knows *that* so I’ll post about *this* ” I assure you I’ll need to know *that*.

So If anyone would like to share some good advice or resources for an absolute kitchen simpleton, anything and everything you think for day one, it would be very much appreciated! 

Thanks in advance!"

KNVB,Question,4,"So I've been slow cooking the chicken breast cause I'm afraid of undercooking it on the stove so I always end up fucking it up and over cooking it. I like to slow cook it then throw it in a pan on high heat to brown it a bit to give it that contrast of texture. 

Problem is, I pretty much just use basic ass herbs in my slow cooker with beef broth for the chicken. Tastes good but it's boring now. 

I wanted to learn how to make basic sauces for my chicken. So I can just bulk make steamed broccoli, rice, slow cooked chicken or slow cooked then browned on a pan. Pretty basic, but I want different sauces to at least change it up. I have no clue how to go about this but I wanted like 5 different sauces on rotation.

guzzo9000,Recipe,123,"My entire life, I've always been under the strange impression that home cooked burgers are thicker, dryer, and shittier, because everyone in my family would cook them on outside grills over coal. 

But that is simply not the best way to make a burger (imo)!

I used to work at Wendy's and would flip patties, so today I thought I'd just try the Wendy's technique to see how good of a burger I can make.

My goal was to make it thinner, because I hate thick burgers, and I wanted to make it hella juicy, just like Wendy's. 

Step one is to recreate the same surface that they use at Wendy's, which is a flat surface so that all of the juices can congregate around the burger as it cooks, as opposed to the juices falling down through the bars on a regular grill.

All I needed was a large non stick pan, which was square in my case. And it worked perfectly, of course. Also, the heat shouldn't be that high. It should cook fairly slowly, over like 8 or 10 mins. If i recall, the grill should be at like 270 degrees Fahrenheit. I put it on med/low heat. The grill at Wendy's was shit so I got good at eyeballing burgers to see if they are done, so I didn't think it was too important to ensure exactly 270 degrees on the surface.

The next step was to recreate the same conditions as Wendy's, so I got the burger and shaped them into fairly flat circles, because squares are hard XD. But the key was to make it cold, because Wendy's burgers are refrigerated before being cooked. So, they were straight out of the refrigerator before being put onto the pan. Also, if you wan't Wendy's quality burgers, you need high fat burgers, the ones with like 27% fat, so that's what I got.

The pan had nothing in it, not even oil, because the burger creates it's own oil. 

So, the process for cooking a burger at Wendy's as as follows, and this is exactly what I did when I cooked my burger at home. 

1. Place the thin, and just refrigerated patty onto the pan surface.
2. Wait until you can see a bit of red blood coming out of the top of the non cooked side of the patty, and then flip the burger. Then, place the spatula over the burger and flatten it by rocking back and fourth on the left and then right side. It should increase the radius of the burger by a factor of 1.5, or something. The burger will eventually shrink again, but apparently this makes for a better burger. Don't flatten the burger anymore after this first initial flattening because it will make it less juicy.
3. Flip a few more times while waiting like a minute or two between flips, and keep it in the same spot with all of the juices around it. Salt/pepper, on both sides, in the middle of the cooking process, not before or right after.

Then you should be done. Add a slice of cheese onto the top of the patty right after it reaches the level of cookness that you like. I tend to cook it all the way through because it still is juicy as hell. I can tell it is done based on look because Wendy's gave me that ability. 

You can stab the center with a spatula and bend upwards to take a peak into the center.

What I did was created a double stacked burger with 2 patties that were the same thickness as Wendy's. It was about 1.5 cm, or something. Each patty had cheese, so there was nice cheesy goodness in the center of all the meat. And I obviously added my favorite burger fixin's. 

Now, when i say that this burger was juicy as hell, I am not playing. This burger was a dream. Why hasn't anyone in my family figured this stuff out? It is so fast and easy to cook and prepare. Took me about 10 to 15 mins to cook, and you can obviously add a lot more burgers onto a pan, if you have a big enough one. I am so excited to cook this for my friends in the future. I seriously think they will be blown away. 

Disclaimer, this burger is fattening as hell and will kill you if you consume daily for 5 years. Also, this post was more of a technique, rather than a recipe...

Cherryday11,Recipe,1,"➸ Ingredients \* 

≈130g Medium firm tofu 

2 large tomatoes (150-200g together)  

≈70g edamame (2 handfuls)  

1 spring onion (scallion) 

1 clove of garlic 

 A thin slice of ginger 

A pinch of salt, sugar and soy sauce (to taste, but roughly 1tsp)   

&amp;#x200B;

➸ Instructions  

1. Prepare the seasoning ingredients: Slice the spring onion (scallion) into roughly 1cm long pieces, if you want you can leave a small length to thinly slice for garnish. Peel the garlic and slice into 2-3 pieces. Cut off the ginger's skin and cut in half.  

2. Prepare the ingredients: Cube the tofu (I cut mine into 16 cubes of roughly 2x2cm). Slice the tomatoes into 1/6ths, cutting them into wedge shapes (like an orange, although you could cut cubes if you want. I just find wedges hold their shape well whilst still letting juices out).  

3. Add a little oil to your pot and preheat to medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, stirring until sizzling and fragrant. Add the spring onions and stir fry for a roughly 1 minute.  

4. Once the garlic begins to take on some colour, add the edamame and mix well.  

5. Add tomatoes and add a big pinch of salt directly onto the them, follow with a smaller pinch of sugar. Stir well and add the tofu.  

6. The tomatoes should begin to release their juices, once you can see them bubbling slightly close the lid and turn down the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes.

≈130g Medium firm tofu 

2 large tomatoes (150-200g together)  

≈70g edamame (2 handfuls)  

1 spring onion (scallion) 

1 clove of garlic 

 A thin slice of ginger 

A pinch of salt, sugar and soy sauce (to taste, but roughly 1tsp)   

&amp;#x200B;

➸ Instructions  

1. Prepare the seasoning ingredients: Slice the spring onion (scallion) into roughly 1cm long pieces, if you want you can leave a small length to thinly slice for garnish. Peel the garlic and slice into 2-3 pieces. Cut off the ginger's skin and cut in half.  

2. Prepare the ingredients: Cube the tofu (I cut mine into 16 cubes of roughly 2x2cm). Slice the tomatoes into 1/6ths, cutting them into wedge shapes (like an orange, although you could cut cubes if you want. I just find wedges hold their shape well whilst still letting juices out).  

3. Add a little oil to your pot and preheat to medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, stirring until sizzling and fragrant. Add the spring onions and stir fry for a roughly 1 minute.  

4. Once the garlic begins to take on some colour, add the edamame and mix well.  

5. Add tomatoes and add a big pinch of salt directly onto the them, follow with a smaller pinch of sugar. Stir well and add the tofu.  

6. The tomatoes should begin to release their juices, once you can see them bubbling slightly close the lid and turn down the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes.  

7. Serve! I think it's best with rice but you could equally top noodles with it or eat it on it's own. If you pre boil or bake sweet potatoes or potatoes you could add them in before the tofu and that would work well to!

Kenma2019,Question,6,"Hot take, online chicken recipes at the front of Google are **trash**. They're all almost always the same thing, +/- a different seasoning and they all taste the same. The only difference in taste is the massive amount of seasoning they put on the chicken to make a difference but in actuality after one bite, it's just chicken.

My dad gave me a stupid simple asianesque marinade for the chicken that tastes way better than most of what I've had, even in restaurants, and it's literally just: a pinch of salt, oyster sauce, mushroom sauce, and maybe soy sauce depending on taste. From that point forward you can mix and max to get different flavors like garlic, green onion, ginger, etc. The oyster and mushroom sauce permeate the meat deeper than you'd think, while the garlic/ginger/etc stays on the surface so as to not overwhelm.

cephasthelionheart,Question,14,"So I decided I’d follow a recipe I found online for chicken legs tonight and it didn’t turn out right and I’m not sure if it was a bad recipe or something wrong I did.

The recipe for the chicken leg glaze calls for a mixture of:
*honey, garlic, coriander, salt, pepper, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon lime peel.*

I didn’t have all the right ingredients so I improvised. I had enough honey and I minced up garlic, so I got that right. But I had to use a bit of lemon juice to cover the rest of the lime juice after I ran out of lime. I didn’t have coriander so I figured I’d try something spicy instead so I put in some paprika and a small squirt of sriracha in the mixture.

The recipe calls for the chicken legs to be cooked at 450 for 30 minutes. It said to coat the chicken in some of the glaze the before sticking it in the oven and then pour more on occasionally. I coated the chicken with about 1/4 of the honey glaze and stuck it in the oven. Around 15 minutes in, I could tell something was wrong. The glaze I’d coated the chicken with had expanded across the tray and was starting to bubble. I could tell it was going to burn if I finished cooking the chicken, but it was already a mess so I decided I’d let it finish cooking at this point.
After 30 minutes, the chicken itself was actually pretty decent and tasted good, but the glazed had expanded to cover the whole tray and completely hardened. I have the tray soaking in soapy water right now and I’m not even going to try to clean it until it’s soaked overnight.

So what went wrong? I’m wondering if the recipe was wrong to tell me to coat the chicken with that honey glaze at the beginning since when I’ve made similar meals in the past the glaze goes on toward the end? Was it just because of the honey that I ended up with a mess or was it some sort of combination of the other stuff that I added to the glaze that caused it to expand, bubble, and harden the way it did?",cookingforbeginners,My chicken leg glaze bubbled into a tar mess.

I could tell it was going to burn if I finished cooking the chicken, but it was already a mess so I decided I’d let it finish cooking at this point.
After 30 minutes, the chicken itself was actually pretty decent and tasted good, but the glazed had expanded to cover the whole tray and completely hardened. I have the tray soaking in soapy water right now and I’m not even going to try to clean it until it’s soaked overnight.

So what went wrong? I’m wondering if the recipe was wrong to tell me to coat the chicken with that honey glaze at the beginning since when I’ve made similar meals in the past the glaze goes on toward the end? Was it just because of the honey that I ended up with a mess or was it some sort of combination of the other stuff that I added to the glaze that caused it to expand, bubble, and harden the way it did?"

citrusmango_,Question,247,"I really need help. I hate cooking and I hate eating. I used to be fairly active which forced me to eat actual proper meals, but due to covid and being stuck at home all the time with all sports cancelled, I literally have no need or desire to eat. I get by with coffee in the morning, maybe a bagel with cream cheese or yogurt and granola for lunch, and then a really simple dinner (noodle soup, rice and some vegetables) as late as possible because I always put off eating because I hate eating and I hate cooking. I also drink a lot of green smoothies to get my basic bare minimum nutrients and have some semblance of “health” in my life.

I really need some help with basic meal prepping and making healthy, actual real meals. I am not terrible at cooking, I just despise it. I have an instant pot and have used it here and there, but I find it is quite a hassle doing all this ingredient and cooking prep just for one or two meals for myself.

I feel like, if I won the lottery and hired a personal chef to cook me 3 meals a day and force me to eat 3 times a day at the same time every day, everything else in my life would do a 180 and start turning around. The foundation of health is basic nutrients which I am depriving myself of.

Without the bare minimum of physical nutrition I am really struggling with my life right now. Any help is appreciated.

**EDIT:** Ok this is super awkward I did not expect this post to get as much traction as it did. I will answer a few things that have been repeated in the comments.

I have hated eating my entire life ever since I was a kid. I was a stereotypical picky eater as a kid, hated vegetables etc. I got better as I grew up and started playing sports and needed to actually fuel myself. Even though there are some foods and meals that I love to eat, I still hate eating like 90% of the time. Let me frame it like this - if I could eat a pill that would be all my nutrients for a whole year and I don't have to eat for the entire year, I'd take it in a heartbeat even if that meant missing out on food that I **do** like.

Yes I'm mentally ill lol like anxiety depression all that good shit. I have seen therapists and talked about my eating but they don't think I have an eating disorder. However with covid the last 6 months my eating habits are at an all-time low so maybe it's a ""disorder"" now who knows. I don't have body dysmoprhia i'm not starving myself to look skinny and look good I just don't enjoy cooking or eating. they are massive chores to me and as i'm sure many of you know, basic chores like showering or brushing your teeth can be difficult when you're mentally ill and for me, eating and cooking falls under those chores.

Some people are saying ""why force it when you're sedentary and don't need that much food anyways"" I am hungry almost all the time but I don't eat because I fucking hate eating and I fucking hate cooking MORE that I fucking hate being hungry if that makes sense lol

Because of covid I will not be cooking for other people, or with other people for the time being. but yes i agree cooking in a group or safe place with friends seems fun and healthy.

I'll look into soylent and all your other suggestions.

bakedbeans18,Recipe,4,"hi r/cookingforbeginners. I know Poke Bowls are the new ""thing"" nowadays, but I made my own this past week and wanted to share it with you guys, b/c it was significantly cheaper to make than going to my local Poke Bowl shop and I could add whatever fresh veggies/customizations I wanted. Plus given that we're getting into the HOT summer weeks, this recipe has almost no heat cooking at all.

The whole process from start to finish, including making the rice and defrosting the fish took \~45 mins. YMMV though, depending on your knife skills it I'd estimate the recipe taking from 30 mins - 1 hr. Really anyone can make this recipe, there's no strict rules or what I would call difficult technique - and it's impressive once the final assembly of the bowl is complete.

Below is the ingredients and tools I used, but feel free to sub or add anything you want. That's the best part of Poke Bowls - the customization to do whatever you fancy. Also here is a video of me making it as it does require some prep work, mostly cutting and some basic prep work. The good news though is that, that's pretty much all the technique needed.

[https://youtu.be/1ykyLUX1oZw](https://youtu.be/1ykyLUX1oZw)

It does save a TON of time if you make rice or have some before starting. Otherwise that should be the very first thing you do. Also make sure your raw fish (if using) is suitable for consumption that way, no need to risk it unnecessarily.

**Ingredients**

* Cooked Rice
* ⅓ of a Large Onion
* 1 Medium Zucchini
* 1 Tbsp Oil
* 2 Medium Green Onions
* ½ Cucumber
* 8 - 9 Sundried Tomatoes
* 1 Regular Tomato
* 2 Carrots
* 12 oz Firm Silken Tofu Block
* 1 ½ Tbsp Cornstarch
* 1 lb Tuna Steak (Frozen &amp; Vacuum Packed)

**Tools**

* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Bowls
* Spoons
* Frying Pan
* Stirring Utensil
* Oven (optional)
* Sheet Pan (optional)

**Assembly**

* Cooked Rice on the bottom
* Sauteed Onion and Zucchini and Tofu go on top of the Rice
* Rest of the Raw Vegetables go on top of that
* Tuna goes on top of the Raw Vegetables
* Sauce of your choosing goes on top last

**Cost Comparison**

* Local Poke Bowl Restaurant: $12.95/Bowl
   * Estimate @ ¼ lb of tuna in each bowl
* Local Market Frozen, Vacuum Packed Tuna Cost: $14.99/lb
* Therefore at an equivalent amount of protein, the tuna cost is $3.75/Bowl. Obviously there’s more in the bow than just tuna, but that is the most expensive ingredient.

Full Video Recipe: [https://youtu.be/kbbpElK5Ge8](https://youtu.be/kbbpElK5Ge8)

You will need:

2 Chicken Thighs

2 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce (Full Video Recipe at: [https://youtu.be/xgPqH4xk6Zc](https://youtu.be/xgPqH4xk6Zc))

3 to 4 Tsp of Corn Starch

Vegetable Oil

Steps:

To make this teriyaki chicken at home:

1) Prepare 2 Chicken Thighs that have been deboned with their skins left on. Take some kitchen serviettes and lightly pat dry both sides of the Chicken Thighs

2) Place the Chicken Thighs into a Ziploc bag. Without sealing the Ziploc bag, use a frying pan and slowly flatten out the Chicken Thighs while trying to keep them even.

3) Carefully dust about 3 to 4 Tsp of Corn Starch into the Ziploc bag. Try your best to spread the Corn Starch as evenly as you can onto the Chicken Thighs. Seal the Ziploc bag up and give it a good shake to even coat the Chicken Thighs.

4) Grab a pot lid that is smaller than the frying pan you intend you fry the Chicken Thighs in. Prepare some aluminium foil and gently wrap the aluminium foil around the pot lid.

5) Heat up a pan on medium heat with some Vegetable Oil. Once the pan is hot, place the Chicken Thighs skin side down into the pan. Cover the Chicken Thighs with the Pot Lid and let them cook for about 6 minutes or until the skins on the Chicken Thighs are nicely browned.

6) Flip the Chicken Thighs and let the Chicken Thighs continue to cook for about another 3 minutes. 

7) Remove the Chicken Thighs from the heat and carefully slice each Chicken Thigh into 6 slices. 

8) Add the Chicken Thighs back into the frying pan and add about 2 Tbsp of Teriyaki Sauce. Allow the sauce to reduce and the Chicken Thighs to absorb the Teriyaki Sauce.

AGDude,Recipe,2,"I decided to try making lentil soup.  This result was mildly successful, but it took my tongue a bit to get used to this dish.  The first bowl was good, but the second bowl was better.  I don't think this beats restaurant lentil soup or even canned lentil soup, but admit that I love canned soup .

Steps 1-2 are basically copied from [How To Cook Lentils on the Stove](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-lentils-on-the-stove-116321#post-recipe-12287), though I ignored that recipe's salt and seasonings.  Steps 4-5 are improvised based on [Five Minute Lentil Soup](https://www.christinascucina.com/5-minute-lentil-soup/#mv-creation-72-jtr); I didn't have most of the ingredients.

Ingredients (steps 1-3):

* 1 Cup Dry lentils
* 2 Cups water

Ingredients (steps 4-5)

* 3 Cups water
* Garlic Powder (optional - bouillon includes it)
* Onion Powder (optional - bouillon includes it)
* 1/2 Can Corn
* 1 Cup Frozen Peas
* 1 Cup Frozen Carrots
* 3 Sodium-Free Chicken Bouillon Packets
* 1 Ramen Brick (discard flavor packet)
* 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

Recipe

1. Rinse/Strain lentils.  Remove debris, if any..
2. Put water and lentils in a pot and bring to a rapid simmer on medium-high heat, then drop to simmer.  Simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes.  Add more water as needed, keeping lentils barely covered.
3. Drain Lentils.  Leave lentils in strainer.
4. Bring 3 cups of water to a rapid boil.  Add 1 cup of carrots.
5. After about 3 minutes of boiling, add all ingredients/spices (i.e., garlic powder, onion powder, boillion packets/cubes, ramen brick, corn, peas, olive oil, cooked lentils).
6. Continue boiling until ramen is at desired firmness (about 2-3 minutes).

Probably in future versions I would replace canned corn with frozen corn and the 3 bouillon packets with 1 tablespoon of reduced sodium Better than Bouillon; I've heard Better than Bouillon is far superior to bouillon.  This would increase the sodium from about 600mg (mostly from canned corn) to about 1100mg (mostly from Better than Bouillon).",cookingforbeginners,Experimental Lentil Ramen Soup,1595111264,4,310,"Experimental Lentil Ramen Soup I decided to try making lentil soup.

Most recipes seem to suggest cooking the vegetables first. Is there a reason for that, or is it just as well to add them raw and let them cook as the lasagne bakes?"

MartiMa08,Question,10,"I plan on making gnocchi for dinner (from a pack) never made it before, originally I was going to make all of it and put into a sauce (jarred sauce and stir in some spinach) and put it in the fridge to maybe have tomorrow.

However I’ve been trying to read up on things (I’m paranoid about food safety and a total newb at cooking) and supposedly it’s actually quite dangerous to reheat spinach (who knew!).

Should I just take half of the gnocchi, half of the sauce (both uncooked) and put the rest of each in the fridge to make it all again in a couple of days? 

Or would it keep better if I cooked all of the gnocchi to store half in the fridge and only cooked half of the sauce and store the rest cold?

PaintedSequoia,Question,9,"What are some of the things you feel is important for beginning cooks and bakers to know? Things you wish you had been told much sooner in your experiences?  


From me:  
\- ""Take small bites."" Everything can seem so complicated and overwhelming! Just break it down bit by bit. When you pull out a recipe, don't start cooking yet. Just start by looking over the recipe. Read it through. Don't know what an ingredient or tool is? Don't know what a word means? Look it up online or in the dictionary. Watch a few YouTube videos and/or read tutorials to get a better understanding. Break it down and get to know each part. You don't need to understand or master the whole thing instantly. Like everything, it'll take practice and time. Also, some things are better learned hands on as you go.   


\- ""Everyone started somewhere."" Just stop. Breathe. Take a minute to realize that everyone started exactly where you are with little to no knowledge of the cooking world. They built it up over time and are *still* constantly learning and perfecting. Yes, even Gordon Ramsey. Some may have had easier steps up to be in their current positions, but they were once upon a time just as clueless as you. Also, you may not be trying to be a world class chef, and just the master of the weekend family meal or week day prep lunch or just decent eggs. That's perfectly fine!     


\- ""You don't need all the toys and they should be useful to YOU."" It's so easy to feel like you need all the shiny kitchen gadgets professional chefs and bakers. It's easy to fall into the trap of buying or being gifted items that only have one type of use and gather dust the rest of the time, especially if you don't want to cook big elaborate meals, desserts, and recipes on the regular. As you go, you'll begin to realize that you favor certain pots, pans, utensils, etc for most things. The best tools and items in the kitchen are ones you can use in multiple ways. Sure, that super specialized tool/machine may be really good what what it does, but a simpler more common multi-use tool/machine may be just as good.

**There are no referral or affiliate links here**, I am not benefiting in any way from this. I just enjoy helping others. 

Let me explain my intentions a bit more

I was bored one ~~day~~ week, and I decided to write up a list of all essential items that any kitchen should have. This was meant to help beginners who don't have much or any kitchen hardware, or for those who are looking to upgrade their existing hardware. I decided to also include an ""expanded"" and ""expert"" level of hardware that you will eventually need as well (see the separate tabs on the bottom of the spreadsheet). 

I hand-compiled 95 items, and used product recommendations from America's Test Kitchen and Serious Eats to come up with three different options for each item, at three different price points. So there are currently 279 individual items with prices and links to purchase. 

I feel pretty good with the range of items, I'd say it's about 95% inclusive. If you spot anything I have missed, feel free to let me know and I will add it.

Edit: Just wanted to highlight this great suggestion from /u/BrooklynNewsie

The FDA recommends freezing the stuff for a week before consumption. In your guys' experience how long should you be freezing fish before you can eat it? How do you defrost it without losing significant texture? Are there any 'red flags' I should worry about besides a strong fishy/rot smell?

Ash_Sukea,Question,11,"1. I quite often see frantic gasps of horror whenever someone mentions mashed potatoes and immersion blenders in the same sentence. “They’ll turn all gluey!”.  How are they making these potatoes? Are they just holding down the button and whipping them past all mercy? Or are they being more restrained?
The way I do it is to press the button and when I hit bottom, stop, lift up, move the blender elsewhere in the pot, press the button and repeat until milk(no heavy cream for me!) butter, and possibly cheese shreds are is well- mixed in and desired level of lumpiness(I don’t care for baby food consistency potatoes.). Unless I add white cheese shreds I’m not really getting gluey potatoes. 

2. Little argument with my spouse. They don’t like me using the immersion blender because they think it’s for drinks and sauces and mashed potatoes are too thick and will burn out the motor. I think it will be fine. 

3. Adding butter. I add a few large dollops of butter/margarine to the potatoes before they cook(1-2 potatoes per person depending on size of potatoes plus one for the pot, cut into small pieces, optionally with garlic cloves or chopped broccoli or cut up onion wedge; 6min in microwaveable bowl or such with  breathable lid or perforated saran wrap and a splash of water) then after a drain and a few rinses in hot water I might add a tablespoon spoon of butter or two more. 
They’d rather I just add the one large dollop at the mixing stage and see my method as wasteful(okay yes, it is, and hardly health conscious either, but the potatoes taste so much better, and they agree, but don’t like my method.)


I have a badly designed hand masher which is just a round metal plate on a stick that presses things out to the sides rather than actually mash anything; And an electric handheld that mostly splatters milk, butter and potatoes everywhere. Oh and a stand mixer but potatoes for two in that thing feels a just maybe a bit overkill. 

So do I tell them they can fix the potatoes then if they’re not happy with my method , or do I learn to adapt and adopt a messy, time and energy consuming method that uses less butter?",cookingforbeginners,"Unclear on Immersion blenders and mash potatoes.

mchlumecky47,Recipe,1,"My Full Recipe w/ Pics [Here](https://justkitchin.com/summer-cherry-tomato-fresh-mozzerella-pasta)

Ingredients

*Serves 3-4*

* Half a box of bowtie pasta
* 2 giant handfuls of cherry tomatoes (Shaquille O’Neil’s hands)
* 2-3 cloves of garlic, sliced
* ½ ball of fresh mozzarella (4 oz / 120 grams), diced into bite sized pieces
* Parmesan cheese
* Lots of fresh basil
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper

Method

1. Heat salted water over high heat. Once boiling, add dry pasta and cook until almost done but not quite.
2. Heat a saucepan with several glugs of olive oil over medium-high heat.
3. Once the oil is shimmering and lightly smoking, pour in half of your cherry tomatoes along with a heavy pinch of salt. Stand back because these will sputter aggressively.
4. Once the skin begins to blister, give the pan a shake and let the heat burst the tomatoes. Continue cooking until the bursted-out tomato innards reduce into an ooey-gooey, savory tomato lava.
5. Add sliced garlic and cook until softened.
6. Cut the rest of the cherry tomatoes in half and add to the pan. After a minute, add your pasta along with a ½ cup of pasta water. Cook until pasta is al dente, adding more pasta water if needed.
7. Turn off heat, toss in parmesan cheese, a pinch of black pepper, and an extra splash of olive oil. Season to taste.
8. When ready to serve, generously scatter fresh mozerella and basil over the whole thing. Avoid mixing in the mozzarella, as it will easily clump together when exposed to the hot pasta.
9. Serve with cold white wine and a green salad. Enjoy.",cookingforbeginners,Borderline Too-Easy Fresh Summery PASTA,1594066273,5,257,"Borderline Too-Easy Fresh Summery PASTA My Full Recipe w/ Pics [Here](https://justkitchin.com/summer-cherry-tomato-fresh-mozzerella-pasta)

- Stack the potaties in a rooftile maner (half over eachother).
- Use spices.
- Pour light 0% fat cream on top (200 centiliters).

Sennon,Question,4,"My previous method of following the recipe down to the finest affordable ingredients isn't working as with most recipes I am learning from are hit or miss, mainly miss.

bakedbeans18,Recipe,12,"Hi r/cookingforbeginners. So my family has been making dumplings for as long as I've been alive, and although it can be a labor intenstive process, we wanted to simplify it so that anyone can make them at anytime! Below are the ingredients we used, but you can substitute them for whatever you'd like. The technique is more important than the specific ingredients. Additionally some of the tools might be unique, but we tried to provide other tools that can be used in place.

As a heads up, this recipe can take a bit of time. I would budget 60 - 90 mins if this is your very first try, but keep in mind that making more dumplings than the recipe calls for will increase the time by minimal amounts as the initial setup is what takes the longest.

**Ingredients:**

* Dough
   * 1 ⅓ Cups All Purpose Flour
   * ½ Cup Water
* Shrimp Stock
   * 2 Raw, Defrosted Shrimps with Shells Attached
   * ½ Cup Water
* Filling
   * 1 Cup of Chopped Cabbage
   * ⅓ lb of Ground Beef (or other really any ground meat)
   * 1 tsp Soy Sauce
   * Salt

**Tools:**

* Bowls
* Measuring Cups
* Utensils for mixing/stirring
* Saucepan or small frying pan
* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Rolling pin OR Empty Wine Bottle
* Boiling Pot
* Straining Spoon/Spider

**Directions:**

The process can be broken down into 5 major parts

1. Make the Dough
2. Make the Shrimp Stock
3. Make the Filling
4. Assembly
5. Cooking

**Make the Dough**

* Combine the water GRADUALLY with the flour, mixing as you do this
   * Add dashes of water if the dough is not coming together
* Mix until a cohesive ball of dough is formed
* Dough is done
* Set aside while everything else gets prepped

**Make the Shrimp Stock**

* Defrost the raw shrimp and remove the shells
* Set them in the saucepan or small fry pan
* Add the water
* Bring the stock to a boil, then kill the heat
* Shrimp Stock is done
* Set aside while the rest gets prepped

**Make the Filling**

* Cut the Cabbage into as small pieces as you can
* Add meat and 4 tsp of shrimp to a bowl - mix to combine
* Add the soy sauce and mix
* Add salt to taste and mix
* Add the Chopped Cabbage and mix
* Filling is done

**Assembly**

* Lightly flour a work surface and retrieve dough
* Turn dough out onto the surface and roll it into a snake - about 3/4 inch in diameter
* Pinch 1 inch chunks on the Dough Snake, then rip/cut them off
* Lightly Flour the dough chunks
* Roll each chunk into a ball, then smush them into flat disks
* Use Rolling Pin and roll out the dough chunks, rotating them 90 Degrees after a few rolls to form a circle
* If Dough is sticking to the Roller or table, add more flour to it
* Try to make edges of the rolled disk thinner than the center
   * This lets the dumpling hold more filling and keep shape
* Add about 1 Tbsp to the filling to the dough disk
* Fold dough over itself and pinch the edges to seal - place assembled dumplings on a lightly floured surface to avoid sticking

**Cooking**

* Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add dumplings
* Gently agitate the water and dumplings to avoid sticking to each other or the pot - Working in batches makes it easier
* Cover and bring back to a boil
* Once boiling again, gently stir the dumplings and add A BIT of cold water to the pot - cover and repeat this process for 6 - 7 mins
* Dumplings should float to the surface and come back up when pressed down
* Use the Straining Spoon to scoop dumplings - make sure to shake the excess water out when scooping

Let them cool for a bit and that's it! You're done and can enjoy your own 100% homemade dumplings! Again, feel free to freestyle and add/sub ingredients that you find interesting. For example, the raw shrimp can be cut into pieces and added to the filling.

**Video of the whole process:** [https://youtu.be/qkMUSdm4cFM](https://youtu.be/qkMUSdm4cFM)

Let me know how this goes for you guys and if you changed the recipe at all. I'd love to see what you guys come up with, it'll help me improve my dumplings too!

This is my second try at this loaf with similar results.  The first time I figured it was under baked because I cooked it for 22 min only. So this time I bought a thermometer and I cooked for 34 min until  it reached 203f. Removed it and still same results with the raw/soggy dough. Feels weird.

Also are multicookers like Ninja foodi worth it as I’m cooking chicken breast daily alongside veg? Or do they cook as well/quick as a normal fan oven?

MinieVanou,Recipe,0,"Hi guys,
So today I made this easy and so simple creamy cheesy sauce, and I thought it could be useful for people who are just starting to cook but still wanna impress the visit.
This is it!
I used it as pasta sauce but you could just serve it over pork medallions or on a chicken breast and it would lift up the plate's taste.

There you go (white sauce, enough for 4 persons):
 -  First, chop 1 or 2 shallots, as thin as you can. 
 - Cook it in butter (1tbspoon) until the shallots pieces turn kinda brown. 
 - Pour 1/4 cup of chicken broth over the shallots (and if you feel rich, add 1 shot of dark rhum, or white wine). 
 - Bring it back to a boil and let it cook 2 minutes.
 - Add the creamy center (not the crust) of a soft cheese, like Brie. Any cheese you like will work anyways (I used Crémoulin). The fancyer de better :p (go with approx. 2-3 tbspoon of cheese, to taste) 
- Let it melt completely (don't stop stirring until all the cheese is melted).
- Add 1 cup of cooking cream 35%.
- Bring it back to a light boil, add pepper (a lot!), bit of salt, bit of garlic powder if you have some, and a bit rosemary powder. 

DONE! 

- you can sparkle some crushed red peppers on top of the plate for the good look as well as good taste. 

Hope you'll enjoy this easy basic recipe and if you have a try at it let me know! 💛",cookingforbeginners,Easy impressive sauce recipe for begginers out there!,1593826632,8,265,"Easy impressive sauce recipe for begginers out there! Hi guys,

So far everything I’ve made in them either sticks to the bottom, burns, and/or gets really smoky because it’s about to burn — to which I get a ton of anxiety about setting off the apartment complex smoke alarm and quickly just shut off the whole electric stove top. The pans are also getting some discoloration that won’t wash out too. 

Af first, it was really excited about using them, but now it’s daunting and taking up shelf space because I never touch them. Any suggestions on how high the temperature should be to start? Should I use a certain cooking oil? Is it best to only cook certain types of food with stainless steel? How should I clean the pans? Help!"
bakedbeans18,Recipe,1,"Hi r/cookingforbeginners. The recent heat in my area has made me want to make some bean dip. It came out really well and I wanted to share it with you guys! Recipe and video of me making it is below:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 Cans of Beans, drained
* 2 Medium Carrots
* 3 Cloves of Garlic
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Sesame Oil
* 2 Tbsp Peanut Butter
* 1 Tbsp Lemon Juice
* Dash of water (if needed)

The recipe above is inspired by a lot of hummus recipes I've seen. But as I substituted many of the traditional hummus ingredients, you can do the same. This is more of a baseline recipe than anything else. You can sub the red beans for any beans, swap carrots for other root veg (or take em out entirely), use other flavored oils, acids etc. There's no rules here, whatever floats your boat. Sesame oil can get kinda pricey, but a little bit of it goes A LONG way - again though, feel free to use whatever oil instead (garlic flavored oil could be pretty good - just saying).

Let me know how this goes for you all! I'd love to see/hear back on any new creations you guys do to the ingredients above.

DrStupid87,Question,38,"Hi all,

Anytime I make a burger either with meat or veg, I always have trouble making it stick together and it ends up falling apart in my pan.

For meat burgers, I usually add breadcrumbs and for veggie burgers, I add potato mash.

When frying either, I reflexively press them down occassionaly. Could this be my issue?

When I try to flip them to cook the other side, that's when it all goes wrong. I usually fry meat burgers in oil and the veggie ones in frylite.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TheSnicket,Question,2,"Hi everyone!

I love me some Chinese cuisine and my go-to meals are stir-fries. A common thing to do when marinating the protein is to throw in some corn starch which apparently helps coat the chicken evenly and lock in the spice. Potato starch is much more common in my country and I've been using it countless times to thicken sauces in dishes, stir-fries included. When I try to use them in marinades it seems like when I throw it in a hot pan there's too much separated thick liquid that doesn't quite evaporate in the quick cooking process and lowers the heat in my pan that is so important for cooking the protein or insulates the protein a bit. I don't use a wok mind you and I am using an electric stove but it surely gives me enough heat in most cases.

My question is - is potato starch to blame here? I usually convert corn starch to potato starch 1:1, maybe I shouldn't? If not, should I just try to cut back on water (soy sauce/shaoxing wine) or oil in my marinade?

Thanks a lot for the answers!",cookingforbeginners,Would switching from potato starch to corn starch fix my issue?,1593462092,11,188,"Would switching from potato starch to corn starch fix my issue? Hi everyone!

The Sun blazing down upon in my corner of the world and me wishing but not being able to rather be on a beach somewhere, I still wanted to have some sort of Summer activity! Made these 3 homemade ice creams that were fun to make but didn’t require a multitude of work that goes into ice creams made in machines. These are no-churn and eggless. Give it a whirl, more so if you have kids and need a fun activity to do with them. :)

The flavors I did:

1. Vanilla with caramel sauce and choc chips

2. Butterscotch

3. Strawberry

If you’d rather watch a video, it’s [here](https://youtu.be/ztqQadbaE-Q). Just an image? Find it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/2VgwN17). :)

 Here are the ingredients you will need:

For the ice cream base:   
 1. Heavy Cream: 20 oz   
 2. Condensed Milk: 1 can or 14 oz   
 3. Vanilla Extract: 1 tbsp   
 4. Freezer proof plastic containers: 3 nos   
   
 

For the flavorings:

· Vanilla with Caramel sauce &amp; Choc Chip Ice Cream:   
 1. Sugar: 4 oz   
 2. Water: 2 oz   
 3: Heavy cream: 2 oz   
 4. Choc Chips: 2 oz or as desired 

· Butterscotch Ice Cream:   
 1. Sugar: 2 oz   
 2. Roasted Cashews: 2 oz OR any other roasted nuts   
 3. Butterscotch extract: few drops, Optional 

· Strawberry Ice Cream:   
 1. Strawberries, fresh: 6-8 pcs   
 2. Sugar: 2 oz

Steps:

1. Get the flavors ready first. Measure out everything before you start.

2. For the caramel sauce:

a. Put the sugar and water in a heavy bottom pan. Put over medium heat and let it melt.

b. When it becomes amber in color, add cream and whisk like mad. It won’t break if you whisk it like you mean it! To cross reference the texture, check out time stamp 1:50 of my video. 

c. Set aside and let cool

3. For butterscotch:

a. In a pan, put the sugar and let it turn golden over medium heat. Don’t add water at all.

b. When it is golden, add in crushed and roasted cashews \[or any other roasted nut\] and mix well. 

c. Transfer to a lightly oiled plate and let cool. When cool, break into tiny bits to be used later.

4. For Strawberry compote:

a. Wash, dry, and finely chop the strawberries. 

b. Place in a pot, add sugar, and cook over medium heat. 

c. Don’t add water. Cook till it reaches jam like consistency. Again, to cross reference, check out video time stamp 2:30.

d. When ready, set aside to cool

5. For Ice Cream base:

a. Mix the cream, vanilla extract, and condensed milk in a bowl and blend using a hand blender. Blend until it is frothy and creamier than what you started with – about 7 mins.

b. Measure and divide into 3 parts for 3 flavors.

6. Layering the ice creams:

a. For the vanilla with caramel sauce, pour in freezer proof containers, alternating the layers. Add choc chips on top after it has been in the freezer for few hours. Freeze overnight.

b. For butterscotch, mix the candied nuts with the base, add few drops of butterscotch extract \[optional\]. Pour in container. Freeze overnight.

c. For strawberry, mix the compote with the base. Pour in container and freeze overnight.

\* if you’re in a pinch any noodle would taste good, but the alkaline/egg noodle just has a particular bite and get coated by the sauce in a way that makes these so morish

Instructions:

1. To make the sliced egg strip topping:

\- Beat an egg and pour into a well heated (medium high heat), greased frying pan

– spreading the egg out into a thin pancake. Once the liquid has completely set, flip, and fry the other side of a few more seconds.

\- Remove from the heat and put it onto a chopping board to cool. Once cool enough to touch, slice in half, place the

2 halves on top of each other and slice the egg pancake into thin slices. Slicing from one end at a slight diagonal slanted along the rounded side of the semicircle. 2. To make the sauce: mince the slice of garlic and clove of garlic and add into the bowl you’re eating in. Add all of the sauce ingredients and put it aside so that the garlic and ginger can absorb the flavours and release their fragrance.

3. Prepare the other toppings:

\- Slice the spring onion (scallion)

\- Crush the roasted peanuts (use a mortar and pestle if you have one)

\- Cut the cucumber into thin strips. The best way to do this is to cut oval shaped slices at an angle and then turn those slices flat and cut thin strips in line with the long side of the oval.

\- We also like to add chicken breast, just boil it with a few slices of ginger and tear into strips once cooled (it soaks up all of the sauce and is SO good)

\- If you’re using different veg this is a good time to prepare them and set aside

4. Cook the noodles as instructed on the package.

5. Pour the noodles into a big sieve (use a bamboo sieve if you have one) and rinse well with cold water, this rinses the starch off of the noodles and prevents them from sticking together.

6. If you are eating immediately, add a few cubes of ice to the hot noodles and use your hands to mix it until the noodles are cold. If you are making this for packed lunch, picnic, party, or have the time etc. Add a good drizzle of rapeseed oil (alternatively, peanut oil) that has been cooked out and mix thoroughly with your hands. For both cooling methods ‘mix’ means pulling a few noodles up with your hands (kind of like a claw motion) and letting them drop and repeating this.

7. Add the cold noodles into the bowl with the sauce in it. Use chopsticks to mix the sauce into the noodles. Taste it and adjust to your own tastes, you might want it spicier, sweeter, more sour etc.

8. Add all of your toppings and enjoy!

Liang mian can be made for packed lunch, dinner, picnics just like any other countries ‘noodle salad’ style food. Leaving it longer actually lets all of the flavours absorb into the noodles making it very delicious! But it's definitely better to eat it on the day of cooking. Just like rice, when you leave it in the fridge for too long the noodles lose their 'bite' and springy-ness and become too soft. One day should be ok, but more than that might not taste as good.

Omberline,Question,6,"I’m making a brisket recipe (https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/beef-brisket-recipe-1953114) and learned that what I thought was a stovetop-safe roasting pan... actually isn’t, as the metal started burning within a minute of putting it on the stovetop. 

I don’t know what to do as I have nothing else remotely similar to a Dutch oven. This recipe calls for searing the brisket on a stove top, then covering it with foil and putting it in the oven. Is there any way I can use my instant pot instead?

And yes, after this I’ll just go buy a Dutch oven.

eagleoid,Question,1,"So my bagels taste fine, but end up looking like square doughnuts. 

Here's pretty much what i do after taking the dough from the bowl:
* Cut the dough with a scraper into 6 similar sizes.
* Without folding, roll the balls of dough with both hands to create a ball.
* Punch a hole in the center with my finger and carefully spin in a circle in a winding motion with both hands.
* Carefully place bagels into boiling water with a spider 2 min per side. (This is when cracks and folds and deformities start to appear)
* coat with egg wash on cooling rack (one side)
* bake on parchment paper for 35 min
* let cool on a rack. 

Am I messing up in the kneading stage? Should the dough look/feel a certain way before i let rise in an oiled bowl? I'm doing something wrong, I'm just not sure what.",cookingforbeginners,How to perfect bagel shape?,1593202275,5,148,"How to perfect bagel shape?
