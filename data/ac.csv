Question 1: Do these imperial measurements look correct? I don‚Äôt have a scale but I found the initial dough far too firm. Kneading was a massive chore and even when it was smooth it didn‚Äôt seem like it really came together all the way. Initial proof was fine, then when resting it started to dry and crack on edges and when rolling I got a lot of shrink back.

Question 2: when laminating, the butter just came right through the dough immediately, would the dough being dry do this or is it more likely I was too aggressive with rolling, or butter temp, or cheap butter?

End result was like lumpy fall apart biscuits in the shape of a croissant, crispy on the outside soft on the inside butter of course leaked out completely. I baked them just for fun to finish my days worth of work lol",AskCulinary,These are not Croissants ü•ê lmfao help...,1606795099,7,161,"These are not Croissants ü•ê lmfao help... -I used-

TheEuphoria,Technique Question,34,"I bought some nice good quality olive oil and grew herbs from seed through the year to make a few different herb-infused oil for the first time. I *thought* I knew how to make it, it's simple, right; put fresh herbs like Rosemary into a sterile bottle, pour in the olive oil, tighten the cap/top, store in the fridge for a few weeks to infuse, done.

However, while chatting at a friends house last night I was told I've done it completely wrong and would have ruined the olive oil. Never ever put olive oil in the fridge because it goes cloudy and white, then separates and is useless. She told me it must be kept in a dark dry cupboard for a month and once infused it will last a few months before spoiling.

This exchange prompted my brother-in-law to add that we were both wrong, you can't just put fresh herbs into oil, the flavor won't infuse that much, plus the herbs will decay and spoil after a few weeks. He said you must heat the oil and herbs in a pan until nearly simmering, then allow to cool, pour into a bottle, then store in the fridge or cupboard for a maximum of 2-months before it goes bad.

Alfred_Brendel,Technique Question,269,"So I made stock with the leftover turkey carcass from Thanksgiving. Basically stripped the bones as well I could, roasted them at 425 for 20-25 min, broke them open so the marrow could get out, then simmered with onion, celery, carrot, herbs, and about 6 cups of water for about 5 hours. The result was totally delicious, but after straining it and putting it in the fridge it's become completely gelatinous - no liquid at all. The two onions that were in there pretty much totally dissolved during the simmer - there were almost no traces that there had been onion in there at all after cooking everything - so I'm thinking that may be partially to blame.

f00dguy,Equipment Question,32,"I was doing some research and I came across several articles stating that cheesecakes are best once they hit around the 155F degree range.

SleepyStitches,,11,"I just bought a deBuyer blue steel cr√™pe/tortilla pan. The pamphlet instructed me to scrub it clean,  heat oil &amp; potato peels on high heat for ~10m, then clean with hot water and a soft brush and I would be ""good to go"". 

This seemed like the same process as seasoning a carbon steel wok, so I followed a guide I found from cooks illustrated. I finished the potato peel part, dried the pan, added ~¬Ω tsp oil, rubbed it thoroughly with a paper towel until it was almost gone and set it on low heat until it smoked for about 2 minutes, then removed from heat &amp; let it cool overnight. 

This morning I made cr√™pes, rinsed the pan with hot water and a soft brush, and rubbed down with oil. I'm still a bit confused as to whether this post-""wash"" coat needs to be set with heat to polymerize? (if yes, is it high or low heat?) or is it just left on as is for...rust prevention?

This seemed like the same process as seasoning a carbon steel wok, so I followed a guide I found from cooks illustrated. I finished the potato peel part, dried the pan, added ~¬Ω tsp oil, rubbed it thoroughly with a paper towel until it was almost gone and set it on low heat until it smoked for about 2 minutes, then removed from heat &amp; let it cool overnight. 

This morning I made cr√™pes, rinsed the pan with hot water and a soft brush, and rubbed down with oil.

Ahntmizin,Food Science Question,19,"I was reading about the technical background of the maillard reaction, and one thing i noticed was that one example of a maillard reaction thats described everywhere is the brown crust on a steak, yet they also mention that the ideal temperature for maillard is around 140-170, above that you get more and more caramelization, but less maillard, cause the sugar needed to react gets turned into caramel

But i dont know about you, but trying to get good color on a steak is not possible in a 150 degree pan, i generally go to 200+, and while i havent measured it with everything, i assume most vegetables and such that i only shortly cook on high heat for color are also around that temp.

So we always talk about the maillard reaction being the magic drive behind the taste of our food, and i know that in many things it still is, like  in slowly browned onions, or the reduction of a stock, but in many things that are used as prime examples of maillard, like the crust on a steak, or the crust of bread, or the browning when roasting veggies; there wouldnt be a lot of maillard to encounter right?

I followed the steps on making the dough pretty thoroughly (I thought I did at least), like keeping all the ingredients cold, and even using a pastry cutter, and using using only what I need for water.

Problems I faced making the dough: 
1. the main problem is that I don‚Äôt know how much cutting I‚Äôm supposed to do with the pastry cutter. I cubed the butter and chilled it, but it‚Äôs still really hard to cut though, and it left big chunks of butter in my dough.
2. The first time I made the dough, I used the exact amount of water but I ended up with a sticky almost pasty mess, so I used maybe 1/2-3/4 of what the recipe called for in making the dough. Also, I used a half water half vodka mixture. 

Problems with the dough itself:
1. As I mentioned, the dough had large (not gigantic, just some clumps bigger than pinto beans) clumps of butter in it, so when rolling out on a board the butter and dough would stick even though I chilled it for a while.
2. Cold cracking dough and warm sticky dough. The dough out of the fridge was cold and cracking, but 3 minutes later it would stick to everything even though I used less water. (I don‚Äôt live in a super humid or super dry climate in case that matters). 
3. The dough would come apart easily, I didn‚Äôt lend it at all since I though that would melt the fats (warm hands) so the dough would come apart easily, but that could be attributed to the stickyness of the dough.

inamsterdamforaweek,,23,"Hi!

It has come to my attention that chilli peppers could be more susceptible to developing botulism. I have about 15 raw Carolina reapers peppers. I received them from a guy who grows them himself ( think thousands of them- he has a business making hot sauce) and I want to use them to have the challenge with my friends. I have stored them in a bag in the kitchen. 

So today I read that they could develop botulism and kill you. Now this is a shocker to me...all the chilli peppers in the market and even supermarkets here are being sold raw in non-refrigerator areas. No one I know fears eating raw pepper of any kind..no one i know ever had botulism. I asked around about this and no one heard about this. 

Now I just ate a little of one and added another to a stew...and I'm kind of paranoid. Should I throw them away? But then what? Never buy peppers of any kind? Always treat them like bombs? What about garlic? I buy and store the garlic in a bin together with potatoes, onions etc and add them to food as needed. Everyone I know does the same. Are we all waiting to get botulism?

I am confused but also scared.

TrainingNail,,9,"Hi!! I have never made pork before and I wanted to know if this was common or not.

I bough a piece of pork shoulder on Monday from a farm which I usually buy things from (never bought pork from them before). It came frozen and in a sealed bag.

Thing is, today I thawed it inside the sealed bag, since I wanted to leave it marinating overnight. When I cut the bag open a sour smell came out, like a mixture of very very strong raw meat smell, wet pig and just pure stench.

Etcetera-Etc-Etc,,1,"I spatchcocked an 18 pound turkey and have had it dry brining since the weekend. I'm planning to cook it on my gas (propane) grill tomorrow.  Here's my conundrum:

The bird is bigger than anticipated (I was shopping for a 12-14 pounder but couldn't find one) and will take up a large area on the grill.  The grill itself has four burners that run front to back.  When I use indirect heat I use the two outside burners,  but the bird will likely be spread so that the farthest portions are over those burners  I'm hoping for some advice about the best option.

1. Cram the bird into the middle and use burners 1&amp;4

2. Wedge the bird to one side and use only burner 1 (but might have an issue with keeping temperature)

HumanHarvesting,,6,"I bought 2 turkeys 6 days before thanksgiving. One was a 24 lb frozen butterball (8% solution containing water, salt, spices), the other a 16lb frozen ‚Äúnatural‚Äù simply organic turkey(no solution/brine added). I started off putting them in my refrigerator assuming I‚Äôd get them thawed about a day before thanksgiving so I could do a wet brine and have some some drying time in the fridge before I cook them. 

Problem 1: The fridge was obviously way too cold.  After two days the turkeys were still solid blocks of ice. Now I‚Äôm running short on time. 

Solution: turn the fridge up to about 38/39¬∞, obviously should have checked this first. (Making sure to stay below 40¬∞)

Problem 2, Started reading more into brining and different types of turkeys (fresh vs. frozen, natural VS pre-brined, etc). I‚Äôve got one bird that‚Äôs 16 lbs that I could brine with any brine recipe, while the 24 lb has a brine solution already included. With the pre-brined turkey a lot of people recommend not brining as you‚Äôll end up with a ruined salty mess. I reached out to butterball for clarification and advice and they recommended I cut the salt amount in half for any brine, but it was completely fine to brine it. 

Problem 3: I barely have enough time to get these birds thawed in time, let alone do a 3 day brine. 

Problem 4: couldn‚Äôt find any food grade buckets. Already knew not to use a Home Depot bucket. 

Solution: brine and thaw both turkeys at the same time in a storage tote that fits in my fridge? Found a couple brine recipes that cut the salt to about 1 cup (10 oz) : 2 gallons of liquid (instead of the usual 1:1), thus giving the meat more time to equalize without over salting. The recipes recommended 3 days brine time.  I further cut the ratio to 1:3 for sake of the butterball turkey. Both turkeys went in the brine solution as of 3 days ago. They are inside a Sterilite storage tote (5 PP plastic, which as far as I could find, is food grade) and inside the fridge. 

Just checked the turkeys and while they have considerably loosened up and I was able to easily pull out the necks, there was still a little bit of ice inside the bird. 

If they are still not thawed by tonight, I‚Äôm going to have to thaw them using the cold water sink method. I do still want to let them dry in the fridge overnight to get rid of any excess moisture before cooking. (Though most recipes say to immediately cook if thawing this way)

Obviously, if I could go back and do things differently starting 3 days or so before I bought the turkeys I wouldn‚Äôt have any of these issues right now. Lol

If they are still not thawed by tonight, I‚Äôm going to have to thaw them using the cold water sink method. I do still want to let them dry in the fridge overnight to get rid of any excess moisture before cooking. (Though most recipes say to immediately cook if thawing this way)

Obviously, if I could go back and do things differently starting 3 days or so before I bought the turkeys I wouldn‚Äôt have any of these issues right now. Lol 

However I wanted to see if anyone saw any issues with this ‚Äúmethod‚Äù regarding food safety and quality of the finished product."

PicturesOfRichard,,0,"Hello askculinary, 

recently I've been looking into buying both frozen and dried porcini, as my own foraged supply from this season is almost gone. 

I've looked at dried porcini at supermarkets and found that most of the slices had lots of holes in them, stemming from those tunnels that flies and other insects cause. I don't care much for bitemarks on the outside, they are quite easy to remove. But whenever I forage mushrooms for myself, I will remove all the spots that have those ""tunnels"" in them. 

So my question is: Can one reasonably expect to find packages of pristine dried porcini? Are there different quality levels of them where you shop? 

What about the frozen kind? I found different kinds, whole ones/whole caps and larger chunks/dice as the two options.

3) also, does no one run into the problem of the batter going a little crazy like 20 min into the frying of the pancakes?

By the fourth or fifth round, sometimes the baking soda goes into like some turbo mode and then the batter gets so puffy it changes the pancake! Not by a lot, but noticeably. Any experience on that?

I've just came from another failed attempt so I'm feeling really down and hopeless. All I want is to successfully make churros so that I can make them for someone as a goodbye gift before she leaves for the military. Anyone reading this and are expert at making churros, please advice me on what I am doing wrong. I would appreciate it a lot as it means so much to me to be able to make them for someone special. THANK YOU. üò©

JR-90,Recipe Troubleshooting,5,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I made some rice with sausages and tomatoes, first time I ever try this and it tasted good. It was also the first time I ever used that specific pot to cook any rice, it was kinda like [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tower-Essentials-Casserole-Polished-Stainless/dp/B01ICU1QSY), I usually cook pasta in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, first I browned the sausages in it with some oil and then added the rice (uncooked) along some chicken broth. I was moving it at first, like for the first 5 minutes, then left it on its own for like 15-20 minutes before serving and well, the bottom was pretty charred and had quite some uncooked rice stuck to it. I do not know what I did wrong, as I had never had this happen (although I usually cook the rice on its own) and as I would like to try this again, I am aiming for perfection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Food tasted good as obviously threw away the charred bottom, which stayed pretty much covered in burnt and uncooked rice, I even thought I had ruined the pot, but it came out pretty much clean from the dishwasher. 

&amp;#x200B;

spiffyman,,1,"I'm cooking for our pod (4 adults, 1 child) and seem to have purchased a [turkey breast roast](https://www.butterball.com/products/turkey-roasts-and-whole-breasts/breast-meat-roast) instead of an actual turkey breast.

The roast itself looks like a breast that was poorly broken down -- a large breast cut and then a small chunk of meat wholly separated from it; it looks like it's from the same breast but is separated due to an errant cut. It was wrapped in a mesh, but I unwrapped it when I put it in the brine this evening.

normal_communist,,9,"Hi all, I am getting ready to make this recipe tonight:

https://thewoksoflife.com/lotus-root-pork-soup/

I've got my pork soaking and have had my seaweed soaking for a few hours now. The thing is, I bought wakame seaweed and the recipe asks for kombu. This confuses me a bit since I don't think kombu is typically eaten but rather used to add umami to broths. I wasnt checking the recipe as i shopped and grabbed wakame thinking i'd be adding seaweed like you would to miso soup, but looking at the recipe now i'm realizing that's not the case. 

So, i'm wondering....do people eat kombu? Or do you think the recipe is saying to add kombu to enhance the broth but not actually eat it? And should i go for it and try using the wakame, maybe adding dark soy sauce or fish sauce for more umami, or omit it and keep it really simple with pork, lotus, and ginger?

Thus far my noodles have either been chewy or ""snapped"" immediately when bit, but today I was finally able to make a nice al dente noodle. However, I cooked my fresh noodle for ~4 minutes, testing along the way, and it stayed al dente the whole time.  From what I gather this is unusual, as fresh pasta should cook in 1-2 minutes, is that correct?

My process:
- Weigh 200g 00 flour
- Crack 2 eggs into well
- Gradually mix in flour while beating eggs, eventually folding into shaggy dough w bench scraper
- Knead for until dough has smooth texture, spritz with water if dough becomes too tough to knead
- Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap, let rest at room temperature for 30m minimum
- Unwrap dough, cut into sections, wrap all sections but one
- Laminate dough
- Roll out using rolling pin until paper thin (aiming for just a bit thicker than phylo)
- Cut into pappardelle

Theories on what might be going wrong:
- My dough is always very dry and requires a lot of water throughout the kneading process, maybe I need to reduce the amount of flour.
- My kneading technique is not amazing, I only learned the proper way to knead pasta today so I could have poor gluten development because of my bad kneading ripping the dough.
- I don't roll using a pasta machine, so my pasta may not be as thin as I think it is.

What is the cut used in Chinese Braised Beef dishes? This cut in Chinese called ‚ÄúÁâõËÖ©‚Äù is often referred to in English recipes as ‚Äúbrisket‚Äù but is definitely not brisket.

This cut is more gelatinous than it is fatty, and is often served with braised tendon. Authentic Chinese beef noodle restaurants usually offer an option to have the braised beef dish served with half-tendon and half-beef (‚ÄúÂçäÁ≠ãÂçäËÇâ‚Äù). I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs because the cut contains tendon sections, or if tendon is a traditional additional accompaniment in the braise.

While usually referred to in English recipes as ‚Äúbrisket‚Äù, this cut is definitely not brisket: the brisket‚Äôs flat is too lean and the brisket‚Äôs deckle is too fatty; also, neither the flat nor the deckle yield the gelatinous quality of the cut in mind. Lastly, both the brisket‚Äôs flat and deckle are grainy in texture whereas this cut has no discernible grain (you would just cut into equal sized pieces, there is no grain pattern to ‚Äúcut against the grain‚Äù).

This is also not the beef shank. While the shank is also often braised in Chinese food, this is a different braised dish altogether (‚ÄúÁâõËÖ±Â≠ê‚Äù).

The ‚Äúbeef plate‚Äù cut is another possible cut I have heard of in some recipes that correctly point out that the brisket is not the right cut for this dish. I have no experience with the beef plate but perhaps somebody with experience can confirm or refute this.

In preparation for the upcomming thanksgiving holliday I am trying out a new method of cooking the bird, spatchcocked.

So I bought a small 8lb roaster and tried this method, I cut the spine out, which is not as easy as it sounds like it is, and prepared a mix of salt and baking powder and dry brined my turkey over night. 

I then brushed off the dry-brine and put the chicken in a 400 degree oven for an hour. after the hour I tested the thighs and breast and they were not the same temperature. The breast was around 150 and the thighs were around 175.

sk8uno,,3,"I recently started deep frying with tallow instead of oil and I have a few questions for you all.

**1. Does anyone have any great ideas about how to store tallow when not in use?**

I'm mostly interested in containers/methods that make it easy to transfer non-liquid tallow into the dutch oven for deep frying.  I know some people make tallow bars, but I'd rather not have to make bars after every frying session.  I am currently storing the tallow in a tall glass jar, but it is not that fun transferring it to the dutch oven.  I have been bringing it up to room temperature and then scraping it out.  That leaves a lot of unused tallow residue in the jar. I suppose I could warm it to liquid form and pour it out? 

**2.  Any good ideas on how to strain the oil back into its storage container after frying?**

Right now I am using a wide mouth funnel with coffee filters.  It works, but it is extremely slow. Before coffee filters, I used strainers, but they didn't do a good enough job.  I read about straining fryer oil using collagen (thanks to this sub's FAQ), but I'm not sure it will work with tallow because the tallow will solidify.

**3.  Why is my tallow smoking?**

My tallow has been smoking even though I only let it get to 400 degrees F.  (And it starts smoking at temps less than that...)  I check the temp frequently with a Thermapen instant read thermometer.  My understanding is that the smoke point of tallow should be well above 400.  Could the smoke be due to impurities in my tallow?

HobbesDaBobbes,Technique Question,2,"Yesterday I made my first ever 3-tier cake (maybe my first scratch cake ever?).  Shout out to Claire Saffitz's new cookbook.  It was amazing!

But, the heavy, moist stack of **cake really wanted to stay glued to the plate** (especially at the center).  This made serving slices extra tricky and left a big, yummy, crumby mess at the center of the cake.  A minor issue, but it made some of the slices come out as 2.5 tiers instead of 3.  XD

**How can I prevent this issue?**  Especially with this extra moist cake type.

* Sift powdered sugar onto plate?  With a cake this moist and heavy... I'm doubting a dusting will do the trick!
* Maybe a deeper, more pointed cake shovel/server?
* Should I put parchment or wax paper down before the first cake layer?  Maybe even cut it to the pan size?
* If dusting powdered sugar isn't enough for this type of cake, should I smear a base of icing around?
* Is pressing the cake down a little a BAD idea (I read some instructions that put icing down in the middle and press to keep cake from sliding... this cake is NOT sliding ANYwhere XD )
* Would old leaveners make this issue worse?  I think my baking powder was old...
* Should I disregard best flavor/texture and serve it chilled instead of resting it on the counter for an hour or two prior to serving?

It is in such high demand that the waiting time for orders is **One Year**...

Gyoza dumplings are Japonified Jiaozi dumplings from China, the filling is subject to interpretation.  
What I am interested in is the croissant dumpling wrapper.

For ease of construction, I want to use a pasta roller (my motorized Marcato will serve me well), but from there, the variables make my head spin.  
Yeast or no yeast? (I think no, although croissants are a yeasted laminate dough)  
Hydration level? (I want to think a bit higher because of the way gyoza are fried/steamed to cook)  
How many laminate layers? (I would think at least at least 1 full letter turn, but...???)

It is in such high demand that the waiting time for orders is **One Year**...

Gyoza dumplings are Japonified Jiaozi dumplings from China, the filling is subject to interpretation.  
What I am interested in is the croissant dumpling wrapper.

For ease of construction, I want to use a pasta roller (my motorized Marcato will serve me well), but from there, the variables make my head spin.  
Yeast or no yeast? (I think no, although croissants are a yeasted laminate dough)  
Hydration level? (I want to think a bit higher because of the way gyoza are fried/steamed to cook)  
How many laminate layers? (I would think at least at least 1 full letter turn, but...???)

I also read that smaller turkeys are hard to find this year because people are having much smaller gatherings, so I might be stuck with frozen in any event."

practicalmetaphysics,Ingredient Question,3,"Dear AskCulinary, I'm trying to grow as a person and expand my horizons. I'm a pretty picky eater, and I'm making some progress on that. But one thing has really stumped me.

Eggs. 

They have a coppery/metallic taste to me, like blood or having a penny in your mouth. I can taste that tiny big of egg in a bite of fried rice or on the edge of french toast. Puffed oven pancakes, popovers, and eclairs are touch and go. 

For other foods that I haven't liked, the key was preparing them in a way that the nasty flavor was paired with something I like that complimented it. For example, enjoying the green vegetablyness of broccoli eluded me until I tried it roasted with lemon, parmesean and garlic. The brightness of the lemon made the green-ness make sense, and the parmesean and garlic earthiness helped with the vegetable-y flavors. Once I tried it that way, the whole flavor made sense and I could eat it in other dishes. If that doesn't make sense, I can give some other examples.

torschan,Recipe Troubleshooting,39,"I live in Europe just started attempting mexican cuisine. It poses some challenges since authentic ingredients are in the spectrum between scarce and non-existant. Mexican cheese falls in to the latter category so I decided I should make my own queso oaxaca. 

Off I went yesterday and the end result was a rigid rubbery cheese with very little flavor and not at all the smelty elastic goodness I was hoping for. I might add that I have never made any form of cheese before so there are probably a myriad of errors I could have made along the way, either way, here's the steps I took according to the recipe I had:

*Ingredients*  
3 liters of low-pasturized milk (3%)  
45 ml 12% vinegar  
5 ml rennet  
salt and lime to taste

1. I added the milk to a large pot and heated the it slowly to 30C/86F over about 20 minutes, added the vinegar and rennet and whisked it all together. I then heated it to 32C/90F over about 7 minutes, removed it from the stove, put a lid on and let it rest for an hour. 
2. I made a cross pattern in the cheese mass and slowly heated it to 42C/108F, whisked the contents a bit, removed it from the stove and let it sit for another 15 minutes. 
3. I sifted the contents of the pot through a cheesecloth into another large pot, keeping the whey.
4. I added a bunch of salt to the whey and heated it to 80C/176F. I put on some rubber gloves, divided the cheese into three pieces and started to work the cheese after letting it soak in the whey.

At this point in the recipe the cheese was supposed to be stretchable and foldable but I barely managed to stretch the cheese to the lenght of my hand before it snapped. I thought at first it was a heat issue and I let the other pieces of cheese rest longer in the whey in order to heat up but that only made things temporarily better, they still snapped really early and I was left with cheese rubber.

Razultull,,68,"Yea so I used to live in Spain for 2 years, never had an issue before. 

To preface, I usually follow Gordon Ramsay's cookie cutter scrambled eggs technique (cold pan start, keep it moving, low heat etc). 

I also always use unsalted butter as a fat in the beginning, and salt right at the end.

DomStock,,1,"Hi everyone,

We have been working on a new online marketplace tailored for the food-bogging industry for the last weeks and we are currently about to develop our platform.

We are on route to creating a new mix of Blogs/Instagram/YouTube platform where multiple food bloggers can be followed and share their contents easily with followers.

It's a very interesting concept and we have a small team in place and have investors lined up. We have ambitious ideas to contribute to the current food-bloggers tools currently available and believe that we can make an interesting change in the market.

We are currently looking to discuss with current food bloggers and people who are thinking about starting any type of online content in the food area (Recipes, food videos, Diet plans, food photography, etc.)

It would be great to be in touch with some of you about the concept and ask you a few questions so we can tailor our platforms, especially for your needs. This could be via an online call or form - whatever you prefer.

This would only take a few minutes of your time.

In exchange, we would be happy to offer you prime visibility along with monetary contribution/incentives once everything is up and running, 

This will be a ground-breaking concept and could greatly benefit the food bloggers/enthusiasts who will join us from the start.

If you are interested or know anyone who would be, please comment below or send me a private message.

Ring doughnuts using the same recipe always turn out great.

Here is the process:

Starter:

40oz Plain Flour

5 Tsp Yeast

10 Eggs

35oz Warm Water

Mix ingredients together, cover with plastic wrap, let sit ~2 hours. This always gets nice and active- bubbly and growing. 


Dough:

57.5oz Flour

5 Tbsp Yeast

4 Tsp Salt

5oz Sugar

11oz Egg Yolk

5oz Milk

1oz Vanilla

Combine all ingredients in mixer with starter, let mix ~5 minutes. Then slowly add 850g butter, let mix ~8 minutes until dough is shiny and strong. Always passes window test, no tears. 


Proof dough at 25C for about an hour or until doubled in size. Surface of dough remains shiny after proofing and doesn‚Äôt collapse when handled. Dough is then rolled and cut and put on baking trays that are kept in the fridge overnight. 

Here‚Äôs where things get a bit strange. Typically, any dough I‚Äôve worked with in the past sits at room temp for about 30-60 minutes after going through a cold proof and before baking/frying. I‚Äôve noticed that this dough, especially the filled doughnuts, come out of the fridge pretty much ready to go. If I leave them at room temp for even 15 minutes, they overproof (room is usually around 17-20C). So I‚Äôve been cold frying them and, for the most part, they‚Äôve been working out great- especially ring doughnuts. I fry at 182C for ~1-1.5 minutes on each side.

However, the filled doughnuts sometimes have an issue with doming. The side that is fried first becomes the bottom of the doughnut and sometimes I notice that the middle of this side kind of sucks up toward the top, creating a dome effect (I notice because when I flip them, there is a bit of oil that puddles in the middle). The doughnuts do usually achieve the white line in the center, so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on here.

Eventually, I began to smell something burning and went downstairs to find the pot's underside melting into pools in the drip pan and other locations. I had removed the pot, cooled everything down and removed all the globs of melted steel I could see however the electric coil still has a few spots where there's very THIN layers of ~~steel~~ melted on. I uploaded pictures on imgur to show what I'm talking about:[Images of electric stovetop coil](https://imgur.com/a/6Hszu8n)

The melted metal is located on the center piece at the front (where the light is most reflective,) a tiny piece on the 2nd spiral ring from the center on the right side of it, a few tiny pieces on the 3rd spiral ring from the center on the right side and a big piece on the bottom of that same ring.  I have no idea how to remove them and I've been searching all over the internet for information on how to get it off but I've only found information on how to remove plastic &amp; aluminum foil. I can't find any info about removing melted stainless steel. Does anyone know how to get this stuff off?

EDIT: Ok, so looking it up after TotalStatisticNoob's comment, the pot looks like it was a vintage farberware pot with an aluminum base. Not sure if that helps."

happybuddha1,,0,"I am trying to make a low carb version of [Mysore Bonda](https://www.vahrehvah.com/mysore-bonda). 

A typical recipe (omitting some of what doesn't need to be replaced) is to mix all purpose flour, rice flour, baking powder, and curd and fry the resulting batter in small portions (as balls).

So my understanding is that the citric acid in the curd tenderises the gluten in AP flour which results in the bread like structure inside the fried ball. So, I replaced AP flour with almond flour, omitted rice flour as I dont care about what it adds, and added vital wheat gluten at 12% to the almond flour with about a tea spoon of citric acid in addition to curd. My recipe ended up being : 

Almond flour: 1 cup, Curd/Yoghurt: 1 cup,  Vital wheat gluten: 12 grams, Citric acid: 1 teaspoon

As you can imagine the batter didn't hold up in the fryer - so I ended up adding slightly more than a quarter teaspoon of Xanthan gum and a tablespoon of hot oil to get the binding going. Also added about 3 more grams of vwg. The result was fairly good but instead of getting a bready texture inside, I ended up getting something that was gooey on the inside and very oily on the outside. 

Prior to using VWG I had done a few combinations of using some or all of Coconut flour,cream of tartar, psyllium husk and whey protein isolate - none of which gave me anything close to Mysore Bhajji.

1. Buy turkey thighs tomorrow. Place in the freezer.

2. Come Tuesday morning, place in the fridge to thaw.

3. Come Wednesday morning, dry brine.

4. Come Thursday morning, roughly chop vegetables and line the bottom of the slow cooker. Add a cup and a half of broth (not enough to fully submerge the vegetables).

5. Season and brown the turkey thighs. Place over the vegetables. Cook on high for 4 hours.

1. I was thinking of incorporating an herb butter into this dish; would this be overkill with the dry brine? Would I add that before browning the thighs, or after browning and right before putting them into the slow cooker?

cabinantlers,Recipe Troubleshooting,7,"***TL;DR: I cooked pasta with chicken breast and veggies. Although I used fairly standard ingredients, I ended up with a dish that, albeit being relatively tastey, has given me absurd amounts of stomach cramps and left me damn hungry, even after the second portion. I'm frustrated and want to know where I screwed up, so this is a lesson for all future times I'll venture to cook saut√©es again.***

Hey there. I'm not particularly good with cooking in general. I know how to do a simple particular dishes very well (babaganoush, complex, national stews, mashed potatoes and a few more), and other dishes like chicken w/ potatoes in the oven I make decently.

However, there are some things which I keep f\*cking up for a long while now: saut√©s in any combinations. I actually wanted to wait until tomorrow to post this, but my stomach is so upset after eating my own pasta that I got major pissed and just decided to post it now. I need to know what I'm doing wrong, I can't stand this anymore.

So what I cooked just about 5 hours ago was pasta with chicken and legumes. The ingredients:- 1 onion- 1 big carrot- 1 red bell pepper- 7-8 white mushrooms- 1/3 of a big zucchini- 3 gloves of garlic- 2 cans of 250g canned tomato pieces- 500-600g of chicken breast- 400g tagliatelle pasta- salt, pepper, sweet paprika, dry parsley, dry thyme, dry coriander, dry basil, garlic powder, soy sauce

I started off by slicing my onion into tiny cubes and put all of them aside, in a container. I sliced the red pepper into \~1 cm long, 0.5 cm wide pieces, and grated my carrot on the scraper, in thin medium stripes. Put these aside too, in a different container. Then I continued chopping up the mushrooms in slices, and the zucchini I cut longitudinally in quarters, which gave me quarter pieces when slicing.

The chicken I cut into small cubes and marinated it with about a spoonful of olive oil, more than a spoon of mustard, salt, pepper, some lemon juice. I mixed it all well in its original packaging, left it in the fridge, and continued preparing the rest of the stuff for the next \~20 mins. At some point I also put a lot of water to boil in a different container - added salt and just a touch of olive oil to it.

Meanwhile, I heated up my pan, waited for it to get hot, put about 1 full spoon of butter in. I added the onion and mixed throughly on high temp for about 3-4 mins, until the onion was translucent and beginning to barely enter the browning stage. I was adding some salt and pepper to it, too. I then added all of the chicken and proceeded to mix it around. It was probably \~10 mins until all of the meat was white and already kind of boiling in its own juices. At this stage I was also adding more salt/pepper to the mix, followed by some garlic powder, the sweet paprika powder, dry parsley and about 2 tbsps of soy sauce.

Soon enough, I realized this pan won't be big enough for the final mixture, so I took out a bigger, wider one, about 6 cms tall and with a ""straight"" angle between the walls and the base. I put it on the same heater spot and poured all of the mixture into it. When I tasted what I had so far, the flavors seemed way too sweet, bright, eccentric and mixed in a displeasing fashion (think of smelling a strong lilac perfume on someone that's also mixed with a sweet, woody scent and a third pine perfume, all on top of a natural sweat smell - that would be a close analogy). I was surprized to actually faintly taste the mustard I had used for marinating the chicken, alongside another distinct sharp and unfitting taste - a taste you might expect in sweeter Thai food perhaps, but it was just bad in this combo. Could it have been the sweet paprika? That was less than a full tablespoon. Maybe the thyme? That could've been 1-2 tbsps. The dry parsley seemed to daft and proper when I re-tasted it on its own, just to check.

Regardless, from that point forward, I decided I needed to repair this early error by straying away from exotic, bright and sweet flavors and trying to cover it all up with more basic, robust, ground-like flavors: salt, pepper, garlic powder. So, as the cooking went on, I added those things a few more times in turns, tasting and verifying how it's progressing each time.

After the chicken, it was already time for the bell peppers and carrot. I dumped them into the pan and continued to stir on high temp (at some point, I thought/realized I should switch to medium temp, and so I did). I wasn't all throughout stirring, for example, at certain moments I was doing other stuff like cleaning up after previous steps or washing a ustensil, but I think I gave it enough stirring overall. I really tried to avoid overcooking it from my past bad experiences, but this is where I think I failed: the saut√© I had so far was arguably more shrunk and ""mashed"" than what it would look like when my girlfriend cooks random veggies together (and she's an excellent cook). The bell peppers and carrot probably stayed in the pan for about 10 more minutes (or even more?).

I initially wanted to next dump the zucchini first and the mushrooms last, but seeing how far the ingredients were already cooked and beginning to mash togethe, I said screwed it and dumped both the zucchini + shrooms together, to compensate. I also quickly peeled 2 medium cloves of garlic, grated them into a mushy paste-like and added that to the mixture (this being after having added dashes of garlic powder little by little already, in about 3 sittings). I also have to mention that I was worried my mixture wouldn't cook at a high enough temperature, so at 2 different points I kind of pushed the stuff a little and left an empty spot in the pan where I poured about 1-2 spoons of regular sunflower oil, left it to heat up and bubble for like 30 secs, and only then mixed it in the rest of the ingredients. The mixture was pretty big and tall already, so this didn't make it noticeably oilier at all, but I don't know if it helped in any way either.

Anyway, the zucchini and mushroom pieces only had their own \~5-10 minutes of fame in the pot cause I wanted to at least have something which wasn't too overcooked. I tested them and they seemed to be just the right ratio of penetrated by heat vs. resembling their original shape. When I had began cooking, I also wasn't sure if I was gonna complete the mixture with rice or pasta, but now it was already looking to point towards pasta. Because I needed to tie everything together somehow, I took out two 250g of tomatoes (one of them with diced pieces, one of them with full pieces). I added them to the pan and broke up the full tomatoes in the pan with the wooden ustensil, to make halfs of thirds of them. Stirred some more and decided to add another grated clove of garlic, just because I wasn't ""feeling"" it (this later turned out to be a lie).

Also, in the meantime my water had already started to boil, so at least this was pretty good timing. About the time when I was dumping the tomato pieces in the pan, I also put the pasta in the water. Made sure to stir it with the special pasta-grabbing ustensil from time to time, but there was no danger of it sticking anyway, because of the salt and olive oil. Around 9-10 mins later, after adding the final touches to the pan (some more salt &amp; pepper + 1-2 tbsps of dry basil and mixing from time to time, as it was on med heat), the pasta seems done. So I take it and pour it in the pan, on top of the saut√© and chicken, being careful to drip out any excess water. I stir the whole thing up for about 5 more minutes on low heat and that was it.

And now, to the annoying part: when I ate it, the taste seemed good. It looks like I did manage to cover up the overly eccentric mistakes from the beginning, but the food is still a bit odd in terms of flavor. The stripes of carrot aren't visible anymore, and the mushrooms are also hard to find due to overcooking. The most ""intact"" pieces are the zucchini, which also seems to be the most properly cooked of them all. Adding the basil turned out to be a good idea, as it livened up the whole tomatoey dish and completed it nicely. But the garlic was over the top. It didn't hit me right away, but after I eat I'm left with a strong, persistent garlic aftertaste. I realized it's too much. And after I ate a second portion about 2-3 hrs later, I identified the garlic even faster: it's there and it's towering over the other flavors. This wouldn't even bother me too much, I like to eat condimented food - if it weren't for the aftertaste.

Needless to say, after both the first and second portion I am left with cramps and a very upset stomach. I was envisioning this kind of scenario, especially after more than 5 years of f\*cking up most of my saut√©s, but holy heck I didn't think it would be this bad. In fact, the second round of cramps during my second portion started as I was still eating. I had tried to get rid of the problem by going to the problem a while after the first portion, and it kind of worked, mostly. It's just that I got hungy and had to resort to pasta again some time later. I think I have a fast metabolism, so this isn't uncommon for me. I'm a big eater, so the first portion would prolly be 1.5 portions of what a regular guy would eat. However, 3 hours later I am hungry almost as if I didn't know that I even ate (apart from the kind reminders sent by the stomach). And now, just \~an hour after the second portion, I feel that I am hungry once more! All the while having obvious ridiculous stomach gargling. It's in the same vein as the Subway effect, when you eat a 12-inch sandwich and an hour later you're magically hungry again.

So to summarize, I'm really pissed at myself, and, even more than pissed, I am amazed: how could I have f\*cked up such a seemingly uncomplicated dish, with such standards ingredients, so badly? How is it giving me these silly ass cramps, even though it technically tastes all right? Was it the overcooking of some or all of the ingredients? Was it excess garlic powder or garlic cloves? Was it too many/unsuited spices? Was it the manner of cooking? Paying to little or too much attention to stirring? High temp when low was needed?

So what I cooked just about 5 hours ago was pasta with chicken and legumes. The ingredients:- 1 onion- 1 big carrot- 1 red bell pepper- 7-8 white mushrooms- 1/3 of a big zucchini- 3 gloves of garlic- 2 cans of 250g canned tomato pieces- 500-600g of chicken breast- 400g tagliatelle pasta- salt, pepper, sweet paprika, dry parsley, dry thyme, dry coriander, dry basil, garlic powder, soy sauce

I started off by slicing my onion into tiny cubes and put all of them aside, in a container. I sliced the red pepper into \~1 cm long, 0.5 cm wide pieces, and grated my carrot on the scraper, in thin medium stripes. Put these aside too, in a different container. Then I continued chopping up the mushrooms in slices, and the zucchini I cut longitudinally in quarters, which gave me quarter pieces when slicing.

The chicken I cut into small cubes and marinated it with about a spoonful of olive oil, more than a spoon of mustard, salt, pepper, some lemon juice. I mixed it all well in its original packaging, left it in the fridge, and continued preparing the rest of the stuff for the next \~20 mins. At some point I also put a lot of water to boil in a different container - added salt and just a touch of olive oil to it.

Meanwhile, I heated up my pan, waited for it to get hot, put about 1 full spoon of butter in. I added the onion and mixed throughly on high temp for about 3-4 mins, until the onion was translucent and beginning to barely enter the browning stage. I was adding some salt and pepper to it, too. I then added all of the chicken and proceeded to mix it around. It was probably \~10 mins until all of the meat was white and already kind of boiling in its own juices. At this stage I was also adding more salt/pepper to the mix, followed by some garlic powder, the sweet paprika powder, dry parsley and about 2 tbsps of soy sauce.

Soon enough, I realized this pan won't be big enough for the final mixture, so I took out a bigger, wider one, about 6 cms tall and with a ""straight"" angle between the walls and the base. I put it on the same heater spot and poured all of the mixture into it. When I tasted what I had so far, the flavors seemed way too sweet, bright, eccentric and mixed in a displeasing fashion (think of smelling a strong lilac perfume on someone that's also mixed with a sweet, woody scent and a third pine perfume, all on top of a natural sweat smell - that would be a close analogy). I was surprized to actually faintly taste the mustard I had used for marinating the chicken, alongside another distinct sharp and unfitting taste - a taste you might expect in sweeter Thai food perhaps, but it was just bad in this combo. Could it have been the sweet paprika? That was less than a full tablespoon. Maybe the thyme? That could've been 1-2 tbsps. The dry parsley seemed to daft and proper when I re-tasted it on its own, just to check.

Regardless, from that point forward, I decided I needed to repair this early error by straying away from exotic, bright and sweet flavors and trying to cover it all up with more basic, robust, ground-like flavors: salt, pepper, garlic powder. So, as the cooking went on, I added those things a few more times in turns, tasting and verifying how it's progressing each time.

After the chicken, it was already time for the bell peppers and carrot. I dumped them into the pan and continued to stir on high temp (at some point, I thought/realized I should switch to medium temp, and so I did). I wasn't all throughout stirring, for example, at certain moments I was doing other stuff like cleaning up after previous steps or washing a ustensil, but I think I gave it enough stirring overall. I really tried to avoid overcooking it from my past bad experiences, but this is where I think I failed: the saut√© I had so far was arguably more shrunk and ""mashed"" than what it would look like when my girlfriend cooks random veggies together (and she's an excellent cook). The bell peppers and carrot probably stayed in the pan for about 10 more minutes (or even more?).

I initially wanted to next dump the zucchini first and the mushrooms last, but seeing how far the ingredients were already cooked and beginning to mash togethe, I said screwed it and dumped both the zucchini + shrooms together, to compensate. I also quickly peeled 2 medium cloves of garlic, grated them into a mushy paste-like and added that to the mixture (this being after having added dashes of garlic powder little by little already, in about 3 sittings). I also have to mention that I was worried my mixture wouldn't cook at a high enough temperature, so at 2 different points I kind of pushed the stuff a little and left an empty spot in the pan where I poured about 1-2 spoons of regular sunflower oil, left it to heat up and bubble for like 30 secs, and only then mixed it in the rest of the ingredients. The mixture was pretty big and tall already, so this didn't make it noticeably oilier at all, but I don't know if it helped in any way either.

Anyway, the zucchini and mushroom pieces only had their own \~5-10 minutes of fame in the pot cause I wanted to at least have something which wasn't too overcooked. I tested them and they seemed to be just the right ratio of penetrated by heat vs. resembling their original shape. When I had began cooking, I also wasn't sure if I was gonna complete the mixture with rice or pasta, but now it was already looking to point towards pasta. Because I needed to tie everything together somehow, I took out two 250g of tomatoes (one of them with diced pieces, one of them with full pieces). I added them to the pan and broke up the full tomatoes in the pan with the wooden ustensil, to make halfs of thirds of them. Stirred some more and decided to add another grated clove of garlic, just because I wasn't ""feeling"" it (this later turned out to be a lie).

Also, in the meantime my water had already started to boil, so at least this was pretty good timing. About the time when I was dumping the tomato pieces in the pan, I also put the pasta in the water. Made sure to stir it with the special pasta-grabbing ustensil from time to time, but there was no danger of it sticking anyway, because of the salt and olive oil. Around 9-10 mins later, after adding the final touches to the pan (some more salt &amp; pepper + 1-2 tbsps of dry basil and mixing from time to time, as it was on med heat), the pasta seems done. So I take it and pour it in the pan, on top of the saut√© and chicken, being careful to drip out any excess water. I stir the whole thing up for about 5 more minutes on low heat and that was it.

And now, to the annoying part: when I ate it, the taste seemed good. It looks like I did manage to cover up the overly eccentric mistakes from the beginning, but the food is still a bit odd in terms of flavor. The stripes of carrot aren't visible anymore, and the mushrooms are also hard to find due to overcooking. The most ""intact"" pieces are the zucchini, which also seems to be the most properly cooked of them all. Adding the basil turned out to be a good idea, as it livened up the whole tomatoey dish and completed it nicely. But the garlic was over the top. It didn't hit me right away, but after I eat I'm left with a strong, persistent garlic aftertaste. I realized it's too much. And after I ate a second portion about 2-3 hrs later, I identified the garlic even faster: it's there and it's towering over the other flavors. This wouldn't even bother me too much, I like to eat condimented food - if it weren't for the aftertaste.

Needless to say, after both the first and second portion I am left with cramps and a very upset stomach. I was envisioning this kind of scenario, especially after more than 5 years of f\*cking up most of my saut√©s, but holy heck I didn't think it would be this bad. In fact, the second round of cramps during my second portion started as I was still eating. I had tried to get rid of the problem by going to the problem a while after the first portion, and it kind of worked, mostly. It's just that I got hungy and had to resort to pasta again some time later. I think I have a fast metabolism, so this isn't uncommon for me. I'm a big eater, so the first portion would prolly be 1.5 portions of what a regular guy would eat. However, 3 hours later I am hungry almost as if I didn't know that I even ate (apart from the kind reminders sent by the stomach). And now, just \~an hour after the second portion, I feel that I am hungry once more! All the while having obvious ridiculous stomach gargling. It's in the same vein as the Subway effect, when you eat a 12-inch sandwich and an hour later you're magically hungry again.

So to summarize, I'm really pissed at myself, and, even more than pissed, I am amazed: how could I have f\*cked up such a seemingly uncomplicated dish, with such standards ingredients, so badly? How is it giving me these silly ass cramps, even though it technically tastes all right? Was it the overcooking of some or all of the ingredients? Was it excess garlic powder or garlic cloves? Was it too many/unsuited spices? Was it the manner of cooking? Paying to little or too much attention to stirring? High temp when low was needed?

If you wish to enlighten and help a poor soul, I'd much appreciate it. Also, sorry for the long post, this got out of hand as anger was flowing through my intestines."

I covered this thing in Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt by eye, similar to the video I linked above. Should I have measured the salt out instead? I've seen a few weight-to-salt formulas, which I didn't use this time.

After a 24hr dry brine uncovered in the refridgerator, should I be removing excess salt? I wiped off any salt that was still on the bird using a paper towel, but wasn't able to get it all. I read that trying to rinse your bird in the sink is a contamination disaster.

I've had thick cheese cake (YUCK) and I've had thin, softer creamy (not liquid) Cheesecake (the BEST) but compared to Cream Cheese Pie the texture is more silky and smoother than Cheesecake (still not liquid) and you can taste the CREAM even BETTER than CHEESECAKE which is why I prefer the Cream Cheese Pie over a Cheese Cake unless the Cheese Cake is TOP QUALITY.

I've taken off what I can with a spider ladle, but there's still quite a bit. I'm too far into the stock to dump. How bad will this hurt the final product? My goal is a thick cream soup, so I'm hoping I can hide the texture."

ervkv,Equipment Question,2,"TLWR: is carbon steel a viable option for lipped baking sheets? will it too much affect cooking time and temp for easy usability? do they even make carbon steel lipped baking sheets?

i'm on the hunt for lipped baking sheets. of course i check out to see what america's test kitchen recommends and they recommend the nordic ware naturals aluminum baking sheet so i'm gonna get it if it goes on sale for black friday. (btw it might come up but i have absolutely no issue with cooking with aluminum).

but then waiting for black friday had me thinking about the sheets. would it be better to get a nonstick option for cleanup? i've had some bad experiences trying to chip off burned sugar/cheese/oil/bread/etc. is that eve necessary or am i just falling to consumerism and spending extra money? on one hand i would love to replace single use items like aerosol spray non stick cans or parchment paper with a nonstick pan. on the other hand, not sure it's worth it to get a pan that's nonstick. also currently have cookie sheets from williams sonoma/usa pan (pro tip usa pan is the manufacturer for williams sonoma bake ware and they sell their products for cheaper. you're just paying for branding and that gold coating but usa pan still offers non gold nonstick products) and have had the issue of not being able to clean them up completely.

also my general thoughts about coated nonstick items is that they're not exactly r/buyitforlife products. i am not a person who just buys things knowing they don't have a great life span but is ok with purchasing new ones every few years no matter the price.

was reading a blog post about [mushroom bacon](https://detoxinista.com/mushroom-bacon/) and the photos she posted alongside it looked like it was maybe a cast iron baking sheet? i had never thought of this! i would be able to season it and still get that nonstickedness that would make for easy clean ups and eliminate some waste.

I'm hoping someone with more experience can identify the most likely culprit for my failure.

I've made this sausage recipe in the past, and it's come out fine. This time, the circumstances were different, and the texture was dry and crumbly. I also had great difficulty forming the meat into patties, and when I went to case it, the hand crank was much more difficult than normal - I really had to force it to get it through the tube.

So here's what was different about my process this time:

* Dried blueberries instead of frozen. I've run into crumbly farce before while using dried fruit, so I wonder if that might have something to do with it. I noticed that the meat seemed most likely to crumble right around the blueberries, and that the blueberries tended to fall out as I was making test patties. I also noticed that the blueberries fully rehydrated, which makes me wonder if that contributed by pulling too much moisture from the farce.

* The farce sat in the fridge for over a week before casing. Not ideal, but the restaurant was closed for a while due to a Covid exposure, so I couldn't really get to it. Normally I just let the farce sit overnight before casing.

* Possibly a higher fat content? My meat/fat ratio is pretty variable based on what kind of trim we produce during the week, but it's usually right around 70/30, or at most 60/40. This time I noticed a little more fat rendering out when I cooked a test patty. I realize this might also be indicative of an undermixed farce, but I went until I achieved soft peaks and could hold the bowl upside down with nothing falling out, which is my usual process.

Kittech,,11,"I went to the Asian grocery the other day and saw some chicken feet (something I have never cooked with) and while I usually pass it by, I had been craving some dim sum and they were incredibly cheap and I've been in a cooking mood so I thought, heck why not? I'll try making some dim sum style chicken feet and if they don't turn out well, not much lost except maybe some time. I figured I had probably most of the ingredients anyways and if I didn't, I could make do. 

Well, after getting home and poking around for some recipes, I realized this is kind of a lot more work than I thought it'd be. I thought all you'd have to do was braise it and then stir fry it to thicken the sauce or whatever but apparently most recipes say you have to: 1) blanch it, 2) fry it, 3) steam it, and 4) THEN stir fry it. Some of them suggest using a brine and braising in place of some of the other cooking steps, others don't so now I'm confused.

If anyone has experience cooking chicken feet this way, can you explain why it needs to be cooked 4 different ways to get the final product? I didn't realize that so much work went into these things and believed braising it for a long time would be enough to get that gelatinous soft falling off the bone texture for the skin.

josefgabriel,,3,"Hi there.  Please let me know if there is a more relevant sub where I should ask this. I found a couple of similar questions in here.

I recently moved a bunch of stuff out of storage and one of the things is a copper roasting pan.  At first I wasn't sure (and I still am not really) if it was ""real"" or not as I have never owned any copper cookware. I have used cast iron for years and recently got into cooking on carbon steel but I know very little about copper.  The pan belonged to my late wife and although I don't have any particularly high sentimental value to it, I would like to use it if possible.  

It is very heavy for what size it appears to be.  Seemingly more so than cast iron.  I did a little digging and at the least, it looks like it might need to be re-tinned for safety's sake? The thing was in pretty bad shape but I took some barkeeper's friend to it, mostly on the outside, then noticed that the finish on the inside is different. Chromed or stainless steel (or tin) looking.  

I read you aren't supposed to scrub it but I think that will need to be done.  It looks like these can be worth quite a bit, although the only markings I could find on mine are on the handle and say ""made in Korea"".  Which initially might make me think it wasn't worth much (and I am sure its not compared to some other items) but at this point I need to decide what to do before I try to clean it any more.

It looks very similar to something I found here:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1LYTooeL534.
 I used the same sized loaf pan 
 I just reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 of cup instead of 1 and 1/4 cups. So 150 g instead of 240. And I only used white sugar instead of a mixture of white and brown. I also used 2 eggs instead of three

The batter was surprisingly not as watery as she said it would despite adding the same amount of oil and less sugar. 
Anyway I preheated the oven, put it in the oven for exactly an hour. After the first half hour the cake had risen and had domed just like the one in the video. Then I left it for another half hour, and it deflated.

 The cake isn't sunken per se, it just became flat again (with a flat surface). So I'm not sure what went wrong. Other than reducing the amount of sugar, I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes great and the amount of sugar is just how I like it. But I think it looks better when it's domed, especially if made in a loaf pan. 

My question is, what made it rise then fall flat again? Is it the oven setting that's the problem? I use conventional setting. Should I use convection and reduce the heat and cooking time? 

And another side question that happens with all my cake. I usually leave it cool in the pan for 30 minutes or sometimes even longer. I never let it cool for 10 minutes in the pan and the rest on a cooking rack because then it collapses. If I take it out before 30 minutes have passed, it becomes crumbly and falls apart.

rodbroward69,,5,"I picked up this gorgeous cast iron from Field a while back. Finally got around to seasoning it, which Field recommends; they do not season as heavily as Lodge and other competitors. I followed their instructions to the letter; used Grapeseed oil, ensured there's no excess oil, etc. Then repeated that process 2 more times.  


The seasoning didn't look spectacularly strong to me, but I wanted to finally cook something on it, so I pan seared a salmon filet. The filet took much longer than on my stainless steel, and my seasoning looks awful now.  


Should I strip this down with a scratchpad like I often see on youtube tutorials, or just continue to season over it? No idea what I did wrong, really, but I'm determined to get it right. I'm also concerned that the seasoning may have been uneven due to my oven being at a (very) slight tilt.

I love cooking and i always challenge myself to give purpose to the scraps and waste minimal food; for instance, i keep all my meat and veggie trimmings for stock and dry out my mushroom and tomato peels for decoration/spices.

&amp;#x200B;

However I am a bit lost about what to do with artichoke scraps after I'm done removing the heart. I've thought about making stock for risotto and soups:

Should i make this stock only with the artichoke scraps to avoid other vegetables/meats covering the flavour?

I've read some experiences online where this kind of stock has come out bitter: why does that happen and how can i avoid it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also looking for some more creative suggestions than just making stock, if there are any.

I'll prob only need 5-10g amounts at a time so I'm wondering can I just throw the whole bag in there and pull it out to thaw, remove what I need and refreeze or do I need to partition my bag into the single use increments that I'll need? Does it clump together when frozen?

warm_kitchenette,Recipe Troubleshooting,6,"My wife loves the type of tamari almonds that are frequently sold in bulk food stores.   I've been trying to recreate these at home without a ton of success.  I can make tasty almonds, but I'm looking to understand how professional shops make their products with an even, dusty coating of flavor.

The recipe I tend to follow most often now is: 

* Roast raw almonds at 300F/150C for about 20-30 minutes in a convention oven. 
* Let them cool to room temperature, more or less
* Toss in a pan with Bragg's Aminos, Tamari, or Soy.  I've tried all of these, generally preferring Braggs.  Toss pan thoroughly to coat every nut with the liquid.   There should be liquid at the bottom of the pan, but not a lake of it.
* Put in a convection oven at 170F/77C for 10-20 minutes.  (I've also let them in there for much longer, but it doesn't help.)
* Retrieve and toss again with more tamari (or whatever), breaking up clusters, and again making sure every nut is wet with liquid.
* The last two steps are repeated 1-3 more times, using less and less liquid.  Towards the end, grind salt over the nuts while they're still tacky.

This recipe works in that it's tasty.  The nuts are lightly lacquered, dry to the touch, and crispy when bitten.  But I have these questions: 

* How do I get that dusty covering like in the stores?
* How can I better control the crispiness.  Right now, I let the nuts cool, then rush them into air tight containers.  Is there a less frenetic way of doing this?
* What other flavorings would you all suggest?  I just started to experiment with a black garlic umami sauce, but the judge is asleep upstairs and has not yet offered an opinion.

Bottleofapplesauce,,14,"Okay, I just made a Reddit account to ask this. I thought it might get a kick out of people (and I really want to know) so please forgive me if my formatting or question seem odd in anyway.

I'm 23 and just graduated college, my cooking is pathetic even compared to other college kids. I know this for a fact because my friends have straight up told me so and have politely stomached my cooking when it turns out alright. But I want to get better, I wanted to take a cooking class after graduating however Covid-19 has made that nearly impossible. That's why I'm here!

So, how do spices work? I don't understand, what about them makes food have more flavour? How do you use them correctly? And how do you know which you should add to a dish? Other than salt and pepper, which should you keep on hand? Can you put them on food after you cook it or is that a bad idea?

To give you some background on why I'm so out of touch, my parents hate cooking and because we weren't well off they worked a lot.

How do you know which spices will work?,1604875445,15,281,"Genuinely Clueless - How do spices work? How do you know which spices will work? Okay, I just made a Reddit account to ask this. I thought it might get a kick out of people (and I really want to know) so please forgive me if my formatting or question seem odd in anyway.

I'm 23 and just graduated college, my cooking is pathetic even compared to other college kids. I know this for a fact because my friends have straight up told me so and have politely stomached my cooking when it turns out alright. But I want to get better, I wanted to take a cooking class after graduating however Covid-19 has made that nearly impossible. That's why I'm here!

So, how do spices work? I don't understand, what about them makes food have more flavour? How do you use them correctly? And how do you know which you should add to a dish? Other than salt and pepper, which should you keep on hand? Can you put them on food after you cook it or is that a bad idea?

To give you some background on why I'm so out of touch, my parents hate cooking and because we weren't well off they worked a lot.

This is NOT enough meat its barely enough for 3 meals. Are you supposed to lose nearly a kg from cooking. I  usually cook it in the oven gas6 for first hour and a half then gas 4 for the last 2 hours. That still shrinks a bit.  Then today when i cooked it in the slow cooker it seemed to shrink it even more..... Can someone offer any advice.

Terrible cook that would appreciate some of your advice for how to improve my relationship with plant based cooking and make my meals taste better while keeping them healthy.

Hi, I don't know how to start this but here it goes... 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 5 or so years, I've been vegetarian for ethical reasons and more recently I've wanted to get into fully plant-based cooking for the same reasons as well as for health. I find I cannot get myself to eat green vegetables though and I really worry about this for my health as I get older, I'm 26 now. I have mild ADD which makes the planning aspects of shopping for foods and planning the food out quite hard.

The issue I find that I'm having is that no matter what I do if I make a meal from scratch by myself I don't enjoy it. I've always been quite a picky eater combined with having little to no experience cooking as my mum has always cooked for me. I've been watching a lot of vegan cooking videos recently by BOSH or other Youtubers and I have many of their books but I find I just don't like many things.

the only real foods that I find I enjoy are cheese( I don't know what it is about cheese that I like so much though), which I'd prefer to avoid for the reasons mentioned above, as well as very sugary foods such as cakes, which I love more than anything, or sometimes takeout.

I've always been told that I'm a picky eater by my mum and that I need to eat more vegetables but the issue is I'm not choosing to not like these foods, like if I could find a way to eat broccoli that I liked it would make my life a lot easier but I find that even putting it in my mouth will make me almost throw it up.

I also partake in strength training/bodybuilding that means I have to structure my meals around some type of plant-based protein, which I find makes it harder as its another element of the meal I have to control.

Does anyone please have any tips on where I should begin to improve my relationship with food, specifically vegetables and improve my skill cooking? I don't mind certain vegetables such as bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet potatoes. I tend not to like mushrooms either but it's the green veg that I struggle with such as cauliflower, broccoli, kale, spinach. I can't even go near them, but I know they contain the most vitamins that I am no doubt lacking in

iDylo,Food Science Question,5,"When I was working on the line in high-end restaurants, one of the first things I really was surprised about was the use of blended oils in our restaurants for cooking. While we use different EVOOs or nut-oils in vinaigrettes or to finish a plate, the bulk of our cooking was done with ""blended"" oil, which I believe was normally a 1:4 ratio of EVOO and canola oil. The idea being that you can bring in some of the flavor of the EVOO, with the high smoke point of a neutral oil.

Ever since then, although I've left the culinary industry, I've religiously used blended oil at home for cooking. When my squeeze bottle empties out, I put in a 1:4 ratio of my favorite EVOO with a canola oil, or occasional grapeseed/neutral oil. I've never given it much thought since I first learned of it, and it's just become second nature. When I cook nearly anything, whether a hard sear of a pork loin in my cast iron, or just a quick saut√© of veggies I grab my bottle of ""blended"" oil.

They're pretty small (or just plain pretty, my gf loves them so much she's even named them!) and the intention is to use them for serving sauces at the table.  Pepper sauces, jus and gravies etc. It's handy to be able to heat them up on the hob unlike a ceramic pot or a gravy boat.

A few months back when reminiscing of the good times (30+years ago) he was speaking passonately about this knife sharpener he used to use but wasn't too specific on the details, from what I remember he said it had 3 different grist you could rotate it, something in line of a rolling pin with flat sides for the different grits on a mount came to mind, and it was professional grade.
I would like to buy this for him for christmas if possible since he has been wanting to properly maintain our old nice knives for years, but hasnt had the money to do it.
But if I ask for clarification he will know what is up and wont allow me to get it for him

Does anyone have any idea of what this sharpener could be? If not I'm not suprised since I dont exactly have much information ;w;"

ytruhg,Recipe Troubleshooting,15,"I was at a restaurant that served a beef cheek tempura dish with a sweet jalapeno relish on top of it. The meat was more pulled beef style in cubes.

I am going to try to replicate it.  My plan is to:

* Cook the beef cheek in a slow cooker for a few hours (I am not sure how long to)?
* Then make it into cubes and fry it in a tempura. I found [this](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Bacon-Tempura/) tempura recipe for a bacon tempura. But I would need to fry it on all 8 sides.
* And use [this](https://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/recs/2522/Sweet-Jalapeno-Pickle-Relish118275.shtml) recipe for the relish

I came across this when searching for why milk boils over:

‚ÄúAs milk heats, the water in its structure starts evaporating from the surface. This concentrates the remaining fat and proteins into a thicker layer at the top of the pot. This layer eventually becomes so thick that water vapor rising through the milk can‚Äôt break through very easily and gets trapped.‚Äù

The article goes on to say that when the water vapor collects enough strength it pushes through the fat layer which causes the boiling over. 


So the question is if you continually did that I.e high heat to froth up the milk, then take it off the heat then back on the heat and off again many times would it become silkier and have a creamier texture because of water vapour trapped in the milk?",AskCulinary,Does making milk boil over cause it to become frothy as if you did it with a steam wand?,1604533060,19,139,"Does making milk boil over cause it to become frothy as if you did it with a steam wand?

MillionBlueMiles,Recipe Troubleshooting,1,"Hi there, first time posting as I just joined the sub but I was looking for a bit of help with this recipe. First off let me say that this recipe is based of some experimenting, but is partially theoretical at this point. I‚Äôm just starting to sort of coalesce this together from a suite of similar recipes I‚Äôve tried in the past. My main concerns I would like advice on are how exactly to incorporate a bit of fat into lean wild game as well as an overall eyeball test on my glaze. I will pan sear the duck breasts, take them out, then make my glaze in the pan. I will reduce it a bit then throw the duck back in to glaze quickly and then plate it. 

Glaze:
1.5 parts honey
1 part balsamic vinegar
Splash of soy sauce
Star anise pod

Does this look like alright proportions? I know this a little vague on amounts but I rarely measure out things exactly and this is the general guide I‚Äôm planning on using. 

Lastly, I am using wild duck that is fairly lean. I thought it might be a good idea to incorporate a bit of fat in the form of butter for this.

Kastera1000,Ingredient Question,12,"At every breakfast place I've been too, their corned beef hash is extremely tender and soft, almost like fried mashed potatoes with onions and corned beef mixed in. I've got the potato and onion part down, but my corned beef always has too much structure and never really breaks down enough.

My corned beef recipe riffs off of Brad Leone's recipe from BA's ""It's Alive!"": 4-5 lb beef round roast gets poked all over and set in a brine made from enough water to dissolve 3/4 cup salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 tsp pink curing salt, plus some typical herbs/spices and more water to submerge if necessary. It stays in the brine for 4-5 days and gets flipped every day to ensure equal exposure to the brine. After that, it gets gently simmered in some herbed/spiced water with a little vinegar for more flavor for 4-5 hours. After it's done cooking, it's tender and has great muscles separation when cut against the grain, but its texture definitely still stands out in my homemade hashes.

Now, the corned beef I see in diner hashes looks way different from mine, almost like Spam (or possibly canned corned beef, I guess). Are diners just using standard canned corned beef for their hash?

I've been using a flour mixture that is basically 1/3 Semolina and 2/3 Durum and I've fooled around with a couple of different ratios for the egg, oil, and water. I made two recent attempts. The first recipe I tried involved 2 whole eggs, 1/4 cup of water, 3/4 teaspoons of olive oil, 1 1/2 cups of the flour mixture I described above, and 3/4 teaspoons of salt. The second involved 1 1/2 cups of the flour mixture, 1 whole egg + 2 egg yolks, 1/4 cup of water, 3/4 teaspoons of olive oil, and 3/4 teaspoons of salt. For both recipes, I followed pretty much the same process: mixing the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, making a well in the flour mixture and adding the wet stuff to the center, then mixing from the center outwards with a fork and then with my hands. In both recipes I also allowed the dough to rest for an hour before rolling and cutting.

I've tried about ten slightly different recipes that more or less followed the same process and only varied when it came to the ratio of the ingredients. I either get something like I described above (puckered and ugly) or a dough that comes out pretty nice once cooked but is miserable to knead because it is SO dry. I don't have a mixer, but I do have a hand-cranked pasta maker (brand is Imperia if that helps). Is it possible that it could be the pasta maker? I find that it is difficult to continuously crank while holding the pasta and it could be that the speed is affecting the smoothness of the pasta.

waitingforarainyday,Equipment Question,2,"So my ceran stovetop is weird in that too fields get way too hot and two barely at all. The temp control doesn't seem to do anything.

I used this recipe: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alexandra-guarnaschelli/homemade-cannoli-3612578

Problems:
- filling was too cinnamon-y. I will definitely cut it down or omit.
- filling did not set well. It was runny and maybe a little grainy. Not the lucious cream filling I was looking for.
- Shells came out tasting ok, but many of them opened up while frying and are like little boats instead of tubes.

I am fairly certain that I did not roll the dough thin enough. Could that have been the cause of the shells popping open. Does that seem plausible? What other tips/tricks for making beautiful shells?

What is up with runny filling? Ricotta was drained over a mesh strainer over a bowl in the fridge. Cream was whipped to stiff peaks before folding in.

I've purchased a carbon steel wok and tried to season it on the stove but it's far from easy and didn't work out as well as I had expected.

Does anyone know where I can buy a wok with either a metal handle or removable wooden handle, so I can season it in the oven? I've seen a few on Amazon but they seem very heavy for a glass stove. Obviously a flat-bottomed wok.

magnitorepulse,,4,"Recently took an interest in vietnam egg coffee, where you whip yolk, sugar, vanilla, and condensed milk in a separate bowl to make... Not sure how to describe the texture but it's like a thick, sticky foam.

Does this principle work due to the egg yolks, or the condensed milk, or strictly due to a combination of the two?

Also on a separate note, for whisking egg whites, do you typically add in sugar AFTER it's been whipped? I've been getting mixed results, where sometimes I find whipping with sugar makes it easier to form, and other times it makes it impossible to form.

keilahS,Ingredient Question,1,"I just roasted some delicata squash that passed for normal on the surface. It was a little more round than the picture in the HelloFresh recipe, but still very firm, seeds were firm and white, no visible rot. I washed it and cut it in half with a clean knife, cutting board, etc (so, nothing spicy was cross-contaminating it, to my knowledge).

It was in the oven for about 35 minutes at 450 degrees F, seasoned with only salt, black pepper, and olive oil. When it came out, I tasted a small slice and it was... a jalape√±o level of spicy. Underneath the spiciness was some normal squash-like flavor, but it was spicy first before any buttery taste came in. It was also slightly bitter, but not overly so. When tasting just the salt/pepper/oil residue on the pan, it was not spicy, just peppery, so the distinctly spicy taste was certainly coming from the squash itself.

Because I have a history of mild oral allergy to eggplant (but have recently had eggplant with no reaction at all), I asked someone else to taste it. They have no known food allergies but also said it was spicy. So I don‚Äôt think it was that. I never developed hives or felt itchy. Just spicy burning.

I looked ‚Äúweird squash‚Äù up on Google and all I found was info on rotting and toxic squash, neither of which seemed to fit. Because I [can‚Äôt taste bitter very well](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/01/352771618/from-kale-to-pale-ale-a-love-of-bitter-may-be-in-your-genes) (and therefore couldn‚Äôt reliably determine the bitterness level) and because the squash wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbrown sugar sweet potato‚Äù like advertised, I chucked the whole dish.

Any idea what could have caused the weird spiciness?  Was it over/under ripe? Weirdly gone bad? Was its plant mom a jalape√±o disguised as a squash?

It was a little more round than the picture in the HelloFresh recipe, but still very firm, seeds were firm and white, no visible rot. I washed it and cut it in half with a clean knife, cutting board, etc (so, nothing spicy was cross-contaminating it, to my knowledge).

It was in the oven for about 35 minutes at 450 degrees F, seasoned with only salt, black pepper, and olive oil. When it came out, I tasted a small slice and it was... a jalape√±o level of spicy. Underneath the spiciness was some normal squash-like flavor, but it was spicy first before any buttery taste came in. It was also slightly bitter, but not overly so. When tasting just the salt/pepper/oil residue on the pan, it was not spicy, just peppery, so the distinctly spicy taste was certainly coming from the squash itself.

Because I have a history of mild oral allergy to eggplant (but have recently had eggplant with no reaction at all), I asked someone else to taste it. They have no known food allergies but also said it was spicy. So I don‚Äôt think it was that. I never developed hives or felt itchy. Just spicy burning.

I looked ‚Äúweird squash‚Äù up on Google and all I found was info on rotting and toxic squash, neither of which seemed to fit. Because I [can‚Äôt taste bitter very well](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/01/352771618/from-kale-to-pale-ale-a-love-of-bitter-may-be-in-your-genes) (and therefore couldn‚Äôt reliably determine the bitterness level) and because the squash wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbrown sugar sweet potato‚Äù like advertised, I chucked the whole dish.

Any idea what could have caused the weird spiciness?  Was it over/under ripe? Weirdly gone bad? Was its plant mom a jalape√±o disguised as a squash? It‚Äôs driving me crazy, hah!"

My veal shanks are in the oven and smell great, and I have some stuff prepped for the risotto, and got a head start and made the gremolata.  
I followed the recipe given in the link, garlic (3 cloves), parsley (1/2 a bunch from the store), and lemon zest (1 and 1/3 lemon). I made sure to avoid the pith and while I'm no expert zester, I've never noticed my lemon zest bitter before. I washed all of my produce. I tore the stems off of the parsley below the leaves, but didn't pluck each leaf off. I love parsley and have never noticed any bitterness with the bit of stem I mince. I also really enjoy garlic, so the amount shouldn't be an issue based on how much raw garlic I add to my cooking (I'd have put the same amount in a half cup of garlic mayo or in 2 salads worth of vinaigrette).   


I tossed the gremolata by hand and on my way to wash my hands I tasted a lick from my finger and it was suuuuper bitter. I took a spoon and tasted a bit more, and yep, the whole bowl tastes bitter.

Love getting feedback from this sub and was wondering if you guys can help me out here! 

I'm planning a brunch themed birthday for my wife where we'll pretend like COVID isnt happening and it's a normal Saturday where we day drink but at our house. I'm planning on making fried chicken and waffles and was wondering if anyone has feedback on the most efficient way to make fried chicken for 15\~ people.

My initial thoughts going into this is actually sous viding the chickens so I don't need to spend 25-30 minutes per batch at the deep fryer.

**Setup:**

1. Brine chicken overnight (12\~hours total), thinking of Thomas Keller ([https://www.dartagnan.com/buttermilk-fried-chicken-recipe.html](https://www.dartagnan.com/buttermilk-fried-chicken-recipe.html))
2. Set sous vide to 145 for 3 hours 
3. Pat dry chickens and prep at dredge station
4. Batter mixture something Louisiana style with a high protein flour
5. Flour mixture, buttermilk, flour mixture
6. Fry 2-3 minutes for each piece, frying more for color than anything. 
7. Make a season mixture to lightly coat after

With this setup I'd like to think it cuts down my prep time about 25 minutes per batch but wondering if I missed anything in these steps. Has anyone tried sous vide fried chicken before? 

For waffles, I'm really a novice when it comes to baking so I may need more help here. I heard you need to really whisk the egg whites up in order to get a fluffy consistency.

TiredFlower3,,6,"Hi all! 

So I decided to be creative and sort of combine two curry recipes but now I'm concerned I may have messed things up. Last night and into this morning in my fridge I have chicken breasts cut up and marinating in plain Greek yogurt combined with a bunch of spices and things (turmeric, chili powder, fresh ginger and garlic, lime juice+zest, salt and pepper). My original plan here is to put that in a pot today along with a lot of cut up tomatoes, more ginger and garlic, onion, a bunch of veggies, chicken stock, bay leaf, and lemongrass, saute the onion/ginger/garlic with more spices and let the rest simmer until done, basically. 

But it occurred to me overnight that that may *not* be a good idea because I've literally never eaten or heard of hot yogurt in soup. Like maybe it'll break up the yogurt and be disgusting especially with all the acidity from the tomatoes. I *could* revamp by taking the chicken *out* of the marinade and just sauteing it instead of adding all the yogurt in, but I was originally thinking the yogurt would thicken things and make it more of a curry than a soup once I let things reduce.

-Cal: 1 TSP
-Water: 1-2 INCHES above corn
Brought to boil on high heat then simmered on medium heat for 25-30 MINS, turned off then Soaked for 12 hours, rinsed 6-10 times

What Came out: yellow corn, even after washing all skins off to remove the color it was bright yellow (and slight weird smell) grinded in food processor and the flour came out way to yellow and had a strong unbearable smell that gave me a headache (weird throat feeling too)

2nd attempt:
-White corn: 2 CUPS/1 POUND
-Cal: Half a TBSP
-Water: 2-3 inches above corn
Brought to boil then simmered for 30-35 MINS and soaked overnight for 12 hours, rinsed 10-15 times

What came out: quarter of corn was white and the rest was yellow, rinsed the corn but color didnt come off, soaked in plain water for 10-20 minutes color was same, smell from corn was barley noticable, grinded and the flour was more light yellow this time and the flour smelled a little more like corn but smell (from cal?)

For example, I made an [Earl Grey Tea Loaf](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/earl_grey_tea_bread_48452) today (thanks Mary Berry) and I wondered when adding the wet to the dry ingredients if it might benefit from being left for 30 minutes before baking to let the flour rehydrate. 

Second example - I‚Äôve made a [ginger cake ](https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/justins-ginger-cake) recipe that called for you to leave the mix (with the raising agent already included) for a couple of hours before baking. The cake was delicious btw!  

My question is why leave a cake/ sweet bake mix for some time before baking when most recipes seem to bake almost immediately when mixed. 

To clarify I‚Äôm not talking yeasted bakes here so they aren‚Äôt ‚Äòproving‚Äô as such just allowing for flour to soak up any of the wet ingredients. 

Apologies for any formatting etc I‚Äôm on a mobile and thanks in advance for any thoughts here!"

zyndrax,,14,"Hi all,

For some background info, I am 26 and from the US. My partner is 32 and from Mexico.

We had an interesting discussion a few days ago. He does the majority of the cooking, and on that particular day, he made a spinach lasagna, one of his ""classic"" dishes. We ate the lasagna alongside a not-so-amazing baguette (a semi-edible brick, if you will). I made a light joke about how next time we should try the lasagna with a garlic naan. My partner immediately said ""No, you can't have naan with lasagna"". I laughed and said of course you can. Especially since there's no way any naan would be as tough and unappetizing as that baguette we had. There was no way for it to be any worse. But he disagreed. He told me that pasta goes with particular types of breads, and naan wasn't one of them. Eventually, he said I could try it, but he wouldn't be complicit in my crimes against pasta LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the conversation was interesting because I never really considered any type of food to be sacred. I do realize this is partially because I grew up on Hamburger Helper and canned veggies. So I am used to just eating things based off of what I have and what I think tastes good. For him, on the other hand, he is very proud of Mexican culinary tradition, which I get. I would never suggest a change to a Mexican dish. And he is a good cook, so I never have any complaints in that department. But for a not-so-traditional lasagna, I figured it wouldn't be an issue, since he just grabbed the recipe from some American lady who makes that lasagna to hide the veggies from her kids.

TotalStatisticNoob,,3,"Hey, in the past I've struggled with getting a nice crispy bottom on my foccacia. During lockdown I started baking pizza and got myself a baking steel (8mm). I usually bake my 80% hydration focaccia in an aluminium sheet for \~20 minutes at 250¬∞C=482¬∞F. It's \~3cm thick.

walking_throughlife,Restaurant Industry Question,3,"Tl;dr - got an interview on friday for a commis apprentice\* position at a real nice hotel restaurant that's going to involve a ""trial element"" so what should I expect to be asked to demonstrate?  I've not got any proper experience in a professional kitchen (but that's okay bc apprenticeship), but I've got good domestic cooking experience and a proper drive and passion for the kitchen so how should I approach it?

Context - I've been looking to get into the professional kitchen for a little while now, I started out by going to uni studying maths but honestly that was something I'd more or less gone into because of family (parents/grandparents) expectations and I kind of liked the subject and was good at it at school, but I never really had the passion for it.  Being a chef was the first job I remember wanting as a kid when I was 8 and cooking has always been a big part of my life, although it fell to the wayside in favour of academics when that became what my family and teachers etc expected of me (it was always just assumed I would go to uni, apply to oxbridge and maybe get in, go on to a decently paid graduate job, etc) and I started following that path a little.  I really realised it just wasn't for me, the uni environment didn't work for me and the subject didn't inspire me.  Throughout uni I'd started to flirt with cooking again and really got properly into it and I'd often think back to the old dream of being a chef and how if I'd been able to choose my own path and been a little more assertive I'd have done that and eventually decided I'd had enough of uni and how shitty it was making me feel and how much I couldn't stand the subject anymore, quit uni (I'm 22) and have been looking for jobs to get into the kitchen since then. Originally I was thinking of KP jobs and working up or going into restaurants and trying to sell myself and asking for jobs in prep or whatever to work up, but found that apprenticeships are a way into the industry to get training and a job without needing the prior experience so started applying for those at commis level, to start out and get into the swing of things and learn and train to move up and try to get to where I want to be one day heading up a kitchen.

I've got an interview on Friday for one of the places I've applied for a commis apprenticeship with.  The place is a really nice 4-star castle hotel with a really good modern fine dining restaurant attached, with the executive chef being the interviewer and someone who I'd already heard the name of before from things like Great British Menu.  I'm not wanting to get too attached to it as a prospective workplace and get my hopes up too much, but honestly it's exactly the sort of place I want to be working, with the style and type of food I'm really interested in that gets me excited to think about cooking (I'd describe the food as classical dishes done in a modernist way), as well as being the sort of environment that I think I'll be able to really push myself and be pushed in under a really talented and skilled chef who I'll be able to learn a lot from so I'm really wanting things to go well here.

I've done a few interviews for commis apprenticeships already and those went really well.  Both offered me the position, but I didn't take one up because I didn't get the right vibes for the place when I went for interview and the other isn't until a January start and the offer was a provisional ""if we can open with Covid things and you don't find somewhere else in the meantime"" deal.  I'm not too worried about the actual talking and ""traditional interview"" side of things, I don't feel cocky or arrogant about it but having had two offers already gives me a little confidence that I can at the very least sell myself decently well and I've got a few answers to some of the more common questions a little bit smooth now, although this sounds like a much more formal type interview with an hour scheduled in, double what I was told to expect for the other two so I'm a little concerned about what to expect and what level of detail he might want to go into that would make it take so much longer.  It's also a lot more fine-dining a setting so I'm a little intimidated by the whole thing because even though I know that the apprenticeship is designed to accommodate someone starting from zero and passion is more important than experience I still feel more pressure to really know my stuff.

There's also apparently going to be some kind of practical, the college apprenticeship coordinator called it variably a trail element and culinary skills test.  This is what's got me the most nervous because I've not got any kitchen experience besides cooking at home and the other interviews I've done were just talking and more informal.  I'm not really sure what they'll be looking for or what I'll be asked to do.  I'm hoping it won't be anything too intense being a level 2 apprentice position, but I'm worried that they'll be judging me to the same standard they'd judge someone coming in to a more experience based role.  I'm expecting something to do with checking how I use a knife and things like that, and I know I'm going to be extra on top of cleaning as I go and thing like that, but besides that I'm not sure.  I've heard that eggs are a common test for new hires in kitchens so I've been practicing french omlettes and scrambled eggs trying to follow the classical methods (I've got a copy of Larousse Gastronomique that I've really shown some love to since I bought it), but is this the sort of thing that actually happens still or an outdated type of thing that's not a standard anymore?  Again, I can't imagine this being too complex like a ""here's some ingredients, make me something nice"" invention test because it's only a commis apprenticeship so I'm hoping it's mostly looking for some aptitude and basic skill backed up by a passion, but like I said above I'm nervous that because it's a more fine dining kinda place they'll be looking for more skills than the other places I'd interviewed at.  Basically I feel like low level imposter syndrome just over the interview...

Basically I think the question is what sort of questions and trial/test should I be expecting?  If anyone here's interviewed people for apprentice/trainee roles before and has some input on the way they did it that would be aces!

I've also been told that I should ""attend in chef whites if possible"".  I've been able to borrow a set from my housemate's work (waiter in a nice cafe and their kitchen had spares), so should I be bringing these to change there or wear them to it?  From how the email with all the details is phrased it makes me think they want me to wear them to it, but that doesn't sound quite right with things like potential for cross contamination given the current Covid situation...

Thanks in advanced for any input or insight, it'll be really appreciated!!!

\*For anyone not in the UK or not familiar (idk how apprenticeships work in other countries, probably similar but to cover everything for everyone...), apprenticeships here are a proper type of formal training, so not just being an apprentice to a mentor.

* How do I get better as a home cook? I feel like whenever I make a  recipe or even freestyle in the kitchen, I'm not getting better. When athletes want to improve they do drills, play games, and practice. Is  there an equivalent to that for home cooks?
* Is it better for home cooks looking to improve to study specific cuisines that interest  them? If so, then what would you recommend for the best method to study a  cuisine? If not, then is it better to be more of a generalist and know a  bit about a broad range of cuisines?

Again these questions might seem self evident, but any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!"

Darth_Stig,,1,"I had experimented one fall in college to find the perfect caramel dipping sauce for apples and such. It was pretty simple but the ratios were exactly what I wanted. Fast forward 10 years and about 6 computers later, Ive lost the recipe.

The caramel Im after was fairly viscous at room temp. It gave about 4 inches of stretching before breaking all the strings/strands when you dipped into it. You could still easily dip into it. Basically it was what that caramel dip sauce made by Marzetti's is like straight out of the fridge.

This homemade caramel Im talking about when cold solidified was harder than those square caramels you get in the grocery store for caramel apples. It was a perfect medium to roll and use like hard clay. I was going to build a few caramel sculptures for Halloween and let them met into the dipping sauce Im talking about for a party.

I had experimented one fall in college to find the perfect caramel dipping sauce for apples and such. It was pretty simple but the ratios were exactly what I wanted. Fast forward 10 years and about 6 computers later, Ive lost the recipe.

The caramel Im after was fairly viscous at room temp. It gave about 4 inches of stretching before breaking all the strings/strands when you dipped into it. You could still easily dip into it. Basically it was what that caramel dip sauce made by Marzetti's is like straight out of the fridge.

This homemade caramel Im talking about when cold solidified was harder than those square caramels you get in the grocery store for caramel apples. It was a perfect medium to roll and use like hard clay. I was going to build a few caramel sculptures for Halloween and let them met into the dipping sauce Im talking about for a party.

arlingtonwilhelm,,8,"I like french fries and fry them occasionally in a dutch oven with peanut oil. Sometimes I toss some rendered fat of a sort in there, too. I am rather satisfied with how these fries come out; they're appropriately crispy and tasty and fully cooked. Yet, there are a few fries that are *amazing*, because they've achieved some sort of crispiness that is hard to describe. My question at the end of the day is how to achieve this crispiness in more of the fries.

My attempt at the description (I may sound like an idiot): I would describe most appropriately cooked fries as crispy on the outside with a good interior that is a bit potato soft, but not overly so. My dream fry, on the other hand, is very crispy on the outside (but not overcooked, yet maybe a bit more cooked than most), almost glass shatteringly so, while seeming to lack a potato-y interior. It's like they're a husk of fried goodness on the outside, while lacking the interior.

How do I fry fries to get more of this sort of fry? Cooking longer won't work as it'll just overcook fries. I don't know how the addition of fat assists fries beyond flavor, but a particular place I have in mind uses chicken fat in their frying.

The easiest way to get rid of that gamey taste in meat is to marinade it in wine or liquor for a couple of hours before cooking.

Reefguy88,,11," Let me start by saying I am not very experienced in the kitchen. I can cook, but I cannot create, if that makes sense. A friend of mine gave me a recipe for a spicy shrimp dish. It is a seasoning, shrimp, and buckwheat. The issue I am encountering is the buckwheat and seasoning are restaurant quantities, then its portioned out with individual servings of the shrimp. I want to resize the buckwheat/seasoning portions to make enough for **3-4 people** and not have a giant vat of the stuff left over. So can someone help me take these giant portions and shrink it down to a **family meal size**? If possible, explain how you shrank each serving, so I can apply the same method to a couple more recipes he gave me.

**Seasoning:**

Ground Garlic: 850g

Olive Oil: 1670g

Achiote Paste: 110g

Calabrese Peppers: 1700g

Kosher Salt: 20g

Sesame Seed: 125g

Calabrese Pepper Oil: 425g

Directions:

Mix olive oil and garlic in a pot. Cook garlic and oil, stirring so garlic won't burn, until garlic is caramelized. While garlic and oil are cooking, mix calabrese pepper oil, citric acid, salt, achiote paste, and chile paste and process until it is fully mixed. Blend calabrese peppers until they become a puree and mix with the above ingredients. When garlic is done, add sesame seeds to garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Add pureed pepper and seasoning mix to garlic pot and stew for half hour, mixing occasionally.

Kosher Salt: 6g

Directions:

Boil water, then add buckwheat and salt, and simmer for 10-13 minutes. Transfer buckwheat to a bowl or pan.

We are still new to making our own pasta, but love it. We have been using enjoying the Spaghetti and Fettuccine cutters with out Kitchen Aid mixer. 

We recently bought the Capellini cutter because we love angel hair. However, the first time we used it, the plastic parts on the bottom snapped loose and pasta making went down the drain. Kitchen Aid was great and agreed to send us a new one under warranty. 

After receiving the new cutter, we go to make Capellini again, but the same thing happens. 

The first time the pasta was run through the roller until setting 7, but second time we went all the way to 8. Am I doing something wrong, or do you think we received two faulty Capellini cutters? 

We have had no trouble using the other cutters at least a dozen times so far.

I'm planning on making a dozen and keeping them in the brine, with craked shells (for the pattern on egg whites), in the fridge.

pregnantchihuahua3,,8,"Hi all,

I was hoping to make the Aged Rib Roast from Blumenthal's *Heston at Home* cookbook for Thanksgiving. I do have a couple of questions and issues though that I wanted to check on. 

1. The recipe calls for the oven to be set at 140 F (60 C) and to cook the rib roast for about 4-6 hours until it reaches an internal temp of 130 F (\~55 C). Unfortunately, my oven only goes down to 170 F (\~77 C) which is significantly higher. My question is if I should just cook the roast at 170 F (\~77 C) until it reaches that same internal temp, or if something like Chef John's method should be better. His method would be to put it in the 500 F (260 C) oven for 20 minutes and then turn off the heat and let it cook for 2 hours or until internal temp reaches the desired level. I'm mostly hoping to replicate Heston's end result the best as possible. I mean I do have a big dehydrator that goes down to 140 F (60 C), but I doubt it cooks the same way lol.

I have some tahini in my fridge and rather than go out and buy another ingredient I was wondering if I could just fry up some tahini in a little oil to make it more of a direct substitute for roasted sesame paste? Thank you.

Pr0ductOfSoci3ty,,3,"I'm trying to make Cook's country's Pork Tamale Pie Recipe:

Ingredients:
¬º cup vegetable oil 
1 pound ground pork 
6 scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thin 
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried 
Salt and pepper 
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed 
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes 
1 cup frozen corn 
¬Ω cup chicken broth 
4 ounces pepper Jack cheese, shredded (1 cup) 
¬æ cup (3 ¬æ ounces) all-purpose flour 
¬æ cup (3 ¬æ ounces) cornmeal 
¬æ teaspoon baking powder 
¬º teaspoon baking soda 
¬æ cup buttermilk 
1 large egg

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just smoking. Add pork and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. 
2. Stir in scallion whites, chili powder, oregano, and ¬º teaspoon salt and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in beans, tomatoes and their juice, corn, and broth. Bring to simmer and cook until mixture has thickened slightly, 5 to 7 minutes. Off heat, stir in pepper Jack until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
3. Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, scallion greens, and ¬æ teaspoon salt together in large bowl. In separate bowl, whisk buttermilk, egg, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil together until smooth. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter over meat mixture and smooth into even layer. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until topping is golden brown and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Let casserole cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Ingredients:
¬º cup vegetable oil 
1 pound ground pork 
6 scallions, white and green parts separated and sliced thin 
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried 
Salt and pepper 
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed 
1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes 
1 cup frozen corn

¬æ cup (3 ¬æ ounces) all-purpose flour 
¬æ cup (3 ¬æ ounces) cornmeal 
¬æ teaspoon baking powder 
¬º teaspoon baking soda 
¬æ cup buttermilk 
1 large egg

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until just smoking. Add pork and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.

3. Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, scallion greens, and ¬æ teaspoon salt together in large bowl. In separate bowl, whisk buttermilk, egg, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil together until smooth. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter over meat mixture and smooth into even layer.

GreenMaker33,,13,"So last night my girlfriend  and I decided to order Pho from a local shop, but because of covid, we brought it all back home to eat. When we opened the boxes that contain everything that goes in the broth, I saw that the flank/skirt stake was completely raw. It was even sitting layered on top of already cooked meats such as chicken, other cuts of beef and sliced meatballs. 

Now, Ive had pho many many times, including ones with mixes of meats like the one in this order, but never had I eaten pho outside a shop, cooked the dish myself or even heard of a shop just straight giving you raw meat to deal with on your own.

I gave it a quick google search and found that this was done on purpose.

Even reddit post from years ago had some yelp review that was being put on blast for the person not knowing that pho meat is cooked like this.  I was aware that the noodle house would cook the meat but I wasn't fully aware that the broth was the only thing used to do so. 

I followed the instructions as stated on various sites, but when I went to push the meats and noodles into one of our large ramen bowls, there was a considerably large amount of blood from the  raw stuff that had covered the noodles. from there I slowly poured the incredibly hot broth over the meat, but ultimately what it turned into was a fatty jiggly set of meat flaps (sorry for that description, but that that is all I can say).

Is there any daily or routine servicing I could do to the unit that will ensure efficiency and longevity of the unit?

Thanks for the time and consideration.

Please feel free to reply or to direct message me if you prefer. 

Respectfully,

FantasticalSuperNova,,8,"Alrighty, real odd situation for myself. 

I'm cooking something I've never ever eaten or seen made before. 

I watched a few videos, read some recipes and decided to follow a recipe from BA Test Kitchen. 

I've heard and have seen that you can have a Sandier texture that's a bit more akin to medium Nougat. 

I've also seen it be nearly completely solid. 

What I presently have is more akin to a really really soft fudge. I can cut it and shape it. If I hold a slice in my hands it kind of falls over gets softer as I hold it. 

It's not tremendously oily either. 

I'm just at a loss for what it's supposed to actually taste and feel like. I've never had anything even close to this. So not having something to compare it to confuses me. 

I'd like to say that I've had a moderate success. Maybe my sugar just didn't get to the right temp?

neutral_hotel,,8,"Hello,

I'm opening up a cafe with very limited cooking appliances and would like to figure out the best way to cook my potatoes for multiples uses (breakfast tacos/ burritos/ bowls).

So I originally wanted to do hash browns (the shredded style) and cut them into squares for breakfast tacos and bowls, but I don't think it would work with a breakfast bowl where I would need more potatoes, so now I'm leaning towards doing cube pieces of home fries for all three dishes. The important factors to consider:

\- Being able to prep and cook them quick (peeling/ boiling/ oven cooking)  
\- Cooking it well (enough crisp outside/ cooked thoroughly inside. Size of potatoes is probably a huge factor too) and consistently (time vs temperature in the convection oven)  
\- Maintaining its quality over the course of the morning

&amp;#x200B;

The kitchen is tiny and doesn't have a gas system so I have the following equipment:

\- Convection oven that fits four 13x17 sheet pans  
\- Induction Cooker (for boiling potatoes)  
\- Steam table (to keep the potatoes warm but the issue is not getting it too wet/ too dry)  
\- Electric griddle (If necessary I'm thinking I can do the potatoes in multiple parts where I pre cook them and then do a second griddle cook to make them crispy before making my items)

&amp;#x200B;

Other questions:

\- Would somehow boiling them and then cooling them down (dunking them in ice water) be a better way? Then could I make batches a day before and store them to cook them later?

\- Would salting the potatoes during the boiling process be similar to salting any vegetables to take out excess moisture?

2) The recipe calls for a 24 hour marination period. Why is this done when fish is usually marinated for &lt;1 hour? Would it be fine if I dry brined the salmon for 24 hours in a ziploc bag instead?

stickyricedragon,Ingredient Question,10,"Might remember me from the post about the butter this week! It made a really nice gravy, and the butter/fat has been duly partitioned and frozen. Anyway, I roasted a 5 kg turkey and I'm saving up the bones and vegetable scraps to make stock when I have time. I have some questions, as it's my first time doing this.  

- for roasting bones, there's still some scraps of meat on them. Will roasting them at 475 F make the remaining meat on the bones tough and overcooked, or will this be mitigated by the long stock process since they're going to soften up in the stock anyway? (or is it a moot point since it's not being eaten?)

- I have some leftover lemon, bacon, onion and garlic that were roasted inside/on the turkey and used to make the gravy. I strained them out of the gravy and they're currently in my freezer. I was wondering if it'd be a good idea to go into the stock (don't want to waste food), and if so, would it be a good idea to blend them before putting them in? They're already very soft from simmering in the gravy for an hour. 

- can you add leek leaves (the green bit) into stock? Or would it be better to add a whole leek? 

- When adding garlic to stock, should it be whole or minced? Should I brown it before cooking? 

- Opinions on roasting the vegetables before adding them into the stock? This [serious eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/how-to-make-rich-flavorful-easy-chicken-stock.html) article on chicken stock said that using the saut√©ed vegetables was described as ""vegetables had been overcooked to the point of murkiness.""

- Is celery necessary for a stock? I'm not a fan of raw or cooked celery by itself, but it's alright in Borsch soup when it's all soft and doesn't taste at all like celery. 

- should I add shiitake mushrooms to the stock, or will that overpower it? 

- Is one and a half hours (from the above article) enough time for stock, or do you usually go for more time? 

- Should I add vinegar? Seen this somewhere and it's claimed to extract the calcium from the bones but not sure how true it is

- Can I overcook stock? I'd rather have a more concentrated stock as I do have limited freezer space. 

Ideally I'd like something to cook with and don't mind it tasting ""too strong"" or turkey. I'm hoping to make a turkey risotto with the stock (have a bunch of turkey leftovers in the freezer), and I know people usually recommend a light stock for this, why?

Any help and advice is appreciated!",AskCulinary,"First time making turkey stock, have questions!",1603503106,7,483,"First time making turkey stock, have questions! Might remember me from the post about the butter this week! It made a really nice gravy, and the butter/fat has been duly partitioned and frozen. Anyway, I roasted a 5 kg turkey and I'm saving up the bones and vegetable scraps to make stock when I have time. I have some questions, as it's my first time doing this.  

- for roasting bones, there's still some scraps of meat on them. Will roasting them at 475 F make the remaining meat on the bones tough and overcooked, or will this be mitigated by the long stock process since they're going to soften up in the stock anyway? (or is it a moot point since it's not being eaten?)

- I have some leftover lemon, bacon, onion and garlic that were roasted inside/on the turkey and used to make the gravy. I strained them out of the gravy and they're currently in my freezer. I was wondering if it'd be a good idea to go into the stock (don't want to waste food), and if so, would it be a good idea to blend them before putting them in? They're already very soft from simmering in the gravy for an hour. 

- can you add leek leaves (the green bit) into stock? Or would it be better to add a whole leek? 

- When adding garlic to stock, should it be whole or minced? Should I brown it before cooking?

wulfinn,Technique Question,146,"Hi all!

I tried making from scratch fried rice today and while my partner enjoyed it, I felt it was lacking. Let me know if you need more information than below. I didn't add any vegetables as I was going for texture and consistency in the rice and I was adding a separately made broccoli beef stir fry to it.

Equipment:
- well seasoned cast iron pan (as in, glassy fried-egg-sliding seasoning)
- slotted bamboo spatula

Ingredients:
- 2c chilled calrose short grain rice, cooked the night before (washed, soaked for about 25 minutes, then simmered in new water for 20, set for 10, then fluffed and chilled in the fridge overnight)
- 2 raw eggs
- 2-3 tbsp Low sodium soy sauce
- 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil

Process:
- Cooked stir fry (non starchy veggies, cubed beef with marinade) at high heat in skillet and removed. 
- Turned heat to low, wiped out skillet partially (larger bits), then turned heat back to medium high and added fresh oil, letting it heat up for about 2 minutes just before smoking.
- Added rice and broke up across the pan, stirring once.
- Added soy sauce and stirred rice to cover.
- After stirring a couple of more times and seeing the rice start to crisp, I cracked both eggs onto the rice, broke them with the spatula, and stirred them into the rice pretty vigorously. Little bits of egg were throughout the rice.
- Cooked about 2 more minutes, then removed from heat and transferred into the serving bowl.

Result: just a bit off for my taste. The egg flavor was present throughout, but no larger bits since I cooked it in the rice. There were burnt bits of charred marinade that nullified any nonstick qualities the pan has, causing some of the rice to disintegrate and form a hard shell at parts of the bottom of the pan - other bits cooked into the rice, giving it a charred, smoky flavor that was a bit overbearing, unlike what I'm used to from a good steel wok. It was also a bit too salty for my taste without the umami flavor you get from restaurant fried rice.

Mistakes I think I made:
- Cooking the rice in the same pan I made the stir fry in - I added the remainder of the beef marinade while cooking the stir fry, which included some cornstarch, which made a pleasantly sweet and savory sauce on the vegetables. However, I think this is where the charred crust on the bottom of the pan started, and I think it impacted the quality of cooking, the taste, and the ease of cooking the rice. I feel like I should have used a separate pan and heated it up from scratch - I was trying to keep my pan fairly hot and prevent additional dishes. I really don't think it was the actual seasoning of the pan coming off but I'll double check as I clean it - I don't typically use oil that gets brittle enough to flake on higher temperatures like peanut oil or avocado oil. I use standard vegetable oil for baking/frying.
- (Maybe) not cooking the eggs separately. I was hoping the eggs would add some color and flavor throughout, but for bigger pieces and more controllable flavor I probably should have scrambled them in another pan and added them in later. The eggs also picked up some of the flavor already in the pan, which probably would have been fine if I hadn't added...
- Too much seasoning too quickly: I added the soy sauce pretty much right after (like within a minute) starting the rice in the pan. Along with the char and residual flavors from the pan, this made it taste a bit salty without getting the evenly cooked color and umami flavor I'm used to with good fried rice.
- Wrong seasoning: I also started reading up on using fish sauce or oyster sauce in addition to or instead of soy sauce. I always have a bottle of each on hand - this probably would have helped get the golden brown color I was looking for while adding depth instead of salt.
- Using Not a Wok: I LOVE a good carbon steel wok, but unfortunately my apartment right now has an electric coil range, my only wok is not flat bottomed, and I don't have a wok ring, hence why I went for a very well seasoned cast iron instead (like, I don't wash it with soap - after thoroughly scrubbing it with soap the first time I started taking care of it, I have seasoned and reseasoned it obsessively)

ConstantlyOnFire,,2,"Hi all,

I'm baking a 3 layer 8"" chocolate cake from an '80s recipe, which is near and dear to my husband's heart. Unfortunately it calls for 1/4 cup of shortening and I didn't realize it. I don't have any and don't want a separate grocery store trip in this pandemic if I can avoid it. The recipe also calls for 1/4 cup of butter. The recipe came from a cocoa powder ad, and the theory was that the shortening + cocoa powder is supposed to replace baker's chocolate. 

Would replacing the shortening to make it all butter make much of a difference as long as I cream the butter and sugar well? I don't want to change the texture much so that it no longer resembles his childhood birthday cake.

notquitesobad,,2,"Context:  I have two current lines of curiosity right now, checking out the old man take about bagel dough being below 55% hydration, and trying to steer my ciabatta technique (usually 80-85%) up to pan de cristal territory.

Long story short:  today's ciabatta was about 90% using KA bread flour without issue. Based on an easily workable 50% hydration using bread flour for the biga preferment, I dropped my 57% KA Sir Lancelot bagels down to 50% as well. Won't call it a disaster, but it took so long even to get the flour incorporated that there won't be bagels til Friday. So can't really call it a winner either.

But the KA bread's basically my scrap flour (I'm actually unsure what my preferred pan de cristal flour will be, but I've got French and Italian options), and I've got a bag of the KA organic high gluten waiting once the conventional Sir Lancelot's gone (as well as some first clear I'm curious about as the most traditionally Jewish bagel approach). **TL;DR:** Is there a simpler way to figure out what the wettest and driest dough formulae possible for a given flour are without mixing entire batches of dough?",AskCulinary,Easiest way to determine the minimum and maximum effective hydration of a particular flour?,1603339060,14,199,"Easiest way to determine the minimum and maximum effective hydration of a particular flour?

htlpc_100,Technique Question,7,"Hi all,

Been lurking here for a while and soaking in all the expertise, first time poster. 

As the topic says, eggs: what is the secret? I‚Äôm hoping this may spark some discussion of different techniques etc. 

I understand that there are many ways to prepare an egg. I‚Äôve had some success lately in making a 3-egg omelet, beating the eggs with a little milk and then cooking over low heat. 

However, some of my questions relate to doing more than 3 eggs or throwing some tomatoes and onions in the mix etc. 

If I‚Äôm throwing in onions and tomatoes I‚Äôll usually pan fry them on slightly higher heat for a couple minutes before throwing in the eggs. This usually results in slightly burnt (brown bottom) eggs that don‚Äôt fold nicely into an omelet. Then I end up with scrambled egg mix with some veggies tossed in. 

Still good but not the effect im going for. 

Also, for example if you go to a bagel shop and order an egg sandwich they seem to cook the eggs in like 30 seconds on a griddle without burning. 

When I cook in the pan it needs to be a longer time on lower heat, which is fine. But what‚Äôs their secret? 

I‚Äôm using a large pan not a griddle so perhaps that has some impact?

1 1/2¬†tablespoons¬†garlic,¬†minced

INSTRUCTIONS

In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).

Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)

Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.¬†

Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.

Pour the pur√©ed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce.

I used to know how to make good over easy eggs but for some reason I must have forgot a step. 

1.spray a lil bit of cooking spray
2.Crack egg in pan on moderate heat
3.wait a few mins 

Is a hard yolk a result of overcooking or undercooking?"
morrisdayandthethyme,,1,"I found this 12"" copper clad saute pan near me for $30, so about to go pick it up as I've been wanting to try cooking with copper. It's stamped Legion Utensils Scavullo 3-53, then some part numbers. I can't find much information online about the Scavullo line, but it looks like Legion Utensils was a supplier for restaurants and hotels from the 1930s-80s, and per their successor company's website ""pioneered the development of bi-metal cookware production, and the plating of silver, brass and copper on stainless steel."" I assume the cooking surface is stainless steel from that and the photos, and the handle looks like cast iron.

EdwardTimeHands,,9,"I've tried to make a French-style omelette numerous times, and I have something like 30% success rate with it. The other 70% of the time it either cooks too fast and I get large curds like Denny's-style scrambled eggs, or it cooks too slow and I get a pile of mush that I can't roll into shape, like Gordon Ramsey-style scrambled eggs. Does anyone have any tips for how to avoid these heat control errors? 

For reference, here's my typical method:
1. Beat eggs into a fine, consistent liquid, with the whites fully broken down so my fork can come out of the bowl without having any egg globs hanging from it. 
2. Add herbs and pepper. 
3. Heat pan at medium-high heat (closer to the high side to get it started, like maybe at 75-80% heat). Melt butter onto heated pan. 
4. Wait for butter to begin bubbling (about 10 seconds). Turn heat down to about 60-65%. 
5. Pour on eggs and immediately begin shuffling the pan and stirring the eggs with a fork to prevent build-up of curds. Do this continuously until the eggs form a coherent uniform structure that I can begin rolling with a spatula. The eggs should be under cooked enough so that the excess uncooked egg on top rolls down the pan when I tip it forward. 
6. With pan tipped forward, roll eggs down the incline of the pan as if I'm rolling up a carpet. Once the eggs are rolled to the bottom of the inclined pan, fold any excess egg over the top.

1 thing that might have been a bad idea: I made a batch of chicken wings a while ago, but instead of serving whole, I deboned them, saved the bones in the freezer, and included in the stock. Wings were cooked via J. Kenji Lopez Alt's method of salting and baking powdering the day before and roasting in the oven. They did come out too salty, if you think that might have contributed, but I don't really salt my stock until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything else was the same, just took all my veg trimmings for the week (I know to avoid cabbages and asparagus etc) which included parsnips, turnips, onions, leeks, garlic, carrot, and jalapenos, along with the chicken bones and the nubs of the wings that I cut off prior to cooking."

LyxSmash,,4,"Hi,

I'm cooking a 3 course for my mums 60th this weekend.

My plan is to break down a chicken, make a white stock from the carcass and some other chicken bones I have. Then use the dark meat to make a chicken Coq a Vin (I assume the light meat will just get to tough when cooked that long)

My problem is I don't want to make a dark stock as well for the soup and thought I heard somewhere that a white stock can be just as good?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I have trouble with understanding what should I buy in my case. 

Initial info:

- I love brioches
- My average batch size is about 1.5-2 cups (200-250g @ ~450-500g of dough) of flour (I live alone and usually eat at home 1 time per day)
- I do them 2-3 times per week
- I'm tired of manual mixing

So I'm almost ready to buy some kind of machinery that will do butter incorporation for me. My options (prices are actual for the place where I live, order from other countries is not an option):

- KitchenAid Mini @ 570 USD
- KitchenAid 125 @ 770 USD
- Kenwood Titanium (with spiral hook) @ 800 USD
- Ankarsrum Assistent @ 1000 USD
- KitchenAid HD (with lifting bowl and spiral hook) @ 1150 USD

Using apples in the form of juice or else cider vinegar to create that maillard reaction which would bring sweetness similar ( but obviously not the exact same i know) to milk fat and then replacing just regular white sugar with a sweetener which holds more depth in flavour such as molasses or coconut sugar, something along these lines...

nosy_hobbit,,6,"This is my first time dry brining meat. I'm just doing some basic chicken thighs. Not a whole chicken.

As I understood it, the goal is to draw out moisture beforehand to get an extra crispy outside when cooking. So it's as simple as coating the protein in salt and leaving it to dry out in your fridge, on a rack. This allows for air to reach both the top and bottom surfaces of the protein for maximal drying.

&gt;How to Dry Brine Meat  
&gt;  
&gt;General dry brining technique calls for 1/2 teaspoon of  kosher salt per pound of meat, plus whatever other (dried) herbs and  spices you so choose. Pummel everything into a sandy texture with a  mortar and pestle, then rub it onto your meaty canvas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Place the meat in a Ziplock bag and refrigerate 1 to 2  days (though if you're in a rush, just leave it in for as long as  possible). Pro tip:¬†Adding a pinch or two of sugar to your dry brine will help the meat caramelize as it cooks.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;**A few general brining safety tips:**  
&gt;  
&gt;To avoid scary bacteria, **always** brine in the fridge.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;For the same reason, make sure none of your meat is exposed to the air.  
&gt;  
&gt;Always let your meat come to room temperature before cooking.

Most of the above makes sense. Add salt, and leave it in the fridge to prevent bacteria from growing at room temperature. 

But placing your dry brining protein in a sealed ziplock bag and making sure none of the meat is exposed to the air, is the dumbest thing I've read about dry brining. 

Is this legit advice? Why would you not want your dry brining protein to be exposed to air? Everything I've read about the subject implies you want it uncovered to allow for drying. Now I'm worried about food safety and salmonella miraculously leaping off the meat and going airborne to contaminate my fridge.",AskCulinary,Basic Broken-down Dry Brining Technique,1602972702,5,377,"Basic Broken-down Dry Brining Technique This is my first time dry brining meat. I'm just doing some basic chicken thighs. Not a whole chicken.

As I understood it, the goal is to draw out moisture beforehand to get an extra crispy outside when cooking. So it's as simple as coating the protein in salt and leaving it to dry out in your fridge, on a rack. This allows for air to reach both the top and bottom surfaces of the protein for maximal drying. It's also important to leave it uncovered, to allow air to reach the protein and to allow for evaporation.

tabbycat614,,34,"I tried to bake my trusty chocolate chip cookie recipe today in Western Europe and they turned out flatter than frisbees. 

This recipe has served me well in Canada many times over and I follow it to a T using metric measurements. However, when trying to bake it again in Europe it was a disaster. Scroll to the bottom for the recipe ingredients and directions. here is what I did, followed by what I'm thinking of adjusting.

If anyone has experience transposing american cookie recipes to european ingredients  I would be greatful. I saw a post from a year ago about european butter but found the comments inconclusive. conversely, if someone has a good european chocolate chip cookie recipe I would be grateful as I have found nothing.

What I did

* measured in g precisely
* chilled the dough for 19 hours in the fridge before forming balls and baking
* formed the dough balls taller than they are wide, and 33g precisely in weight

Proposed troubleshooting ideas

* I hear flour is unbleached in europe which can affect the outcome, additionally the protein content has an influence: Apparently using t65 flour as opposed to european all purpose worked for someone in France
* I hear the moisture content of european butter is different: I could use slightly less butter according to Stella Park's comment on her recipe (would adopt her whole recipe in that case to preserve ratios)
* increase the oven temperature and decrease cook time
* Add vodka to compensate for added moisture from butter (but how much?)

Recipe

* ¬Ω cup granulated sugar(100 g)
* ¬æ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ¬Ω cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 ¬º cups all-purpose flour(155 g)
* ¬Ω teaspoon baking soda
* 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)
* 4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference  
Preparation

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
5. Preheat oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.

TheAlmightyD,,39,"I make a basic Chinese dish that revolves around some protein coated in a sauce served with rice and some vegetable or small stir fry.

The sauce is basic:

* grated garlic and ginger fried off gently in oil
* (homemade) Chinese five spice mix and red pepper flakes added to bloom
* soy sauce and a small amount of brown sugar stirred in
* cornstarch slurry added and cooked until thick

At this point I add the protein (that I previously fried) fry and serve with said rice and veg side.

I've been looking for something to cut through this sauce that I can add to the dish, something to provide some acidity perhaps, maybe some kind of fruit? I've made the dish using sirloin beef, chicken breast, seitan, and tofu, and all the times I would always be left wishing there was something bright I could add to the rice. 

Here's a few things I've tried that haven't cut it:

* A basic egg fried rice with some carrots and peas
* Added rice vinegar to the rice
* Added Mirin to the rice
* Added Shaoxing Wine to the rice

If this was a non-Chinese dish and it was say a meat gravy I'd look towards adding cranberry sauce or something similar to another part of the dish to impart what I'm looking for. Just that touch of sweet acidity and slight fruity notes that can cut through the heavy flavours that come with such a sauce. I could make the sauce lighter but I was looking for something to add to provide the contrast on the plate, rather than giving up on the flavour profile I have already.

Not too sure where to start looking, I thought perhaps pineapple could be a starting point but I'm not sure if that's too juicy of a flavour. Maybe some kind of pickled fruit? Pickled mango or something?

I also cook a lot of Bolognese and Thai Curries, what pans would be best for this work?

I sterilised the canning jars beforehand and gave them a water bath after to properly seal them, but a lot of websites seem conflicted as to how long it was last and generally give an answer of 1 to 12 months. That's a large variance!

We also enjoyed the process so much we decided to make three chutneys and a maple &amp; smoked bacon jam, but again, the variance is 1 to 12 months.

Does it vary by recipe, or do chutneys/jams etc all tend to last around the same length of time as long as the proper canning process has been followed?

awal89,Equipment Question,11,"One of the biggest barriers to good deep frying in oil at home is it's hard to cycle through multiple batches of cool food added that sucks all the heat out of the hot oil, recovery takes a while.

petertmcqueeny,Food Science Question,7,"I make smoothies for lunch almost every day. I always wing it: just whatever I have on hand, and whatever sounds good that day. I also usually add a handful of supplements and superfoods, depending on what I'm making that day.

So today, this was the recipe:

-strawberry
-peach
-mango
-pineapple
-frozen spinach
-baby arugula
-cucumber
-fresh ginger (used a lot today, I bet it was almost ¬º cup)
-probiotic packet
-2 scoops of whey protein concentrate
-unpasturized apple cider vinegar (I rarely use this, but the bottle was almost empty, so I tossed it all in, and it was a little more than I really meant to put)
-apple juice

...and guys, I'm telling you, it doubled in size. It formed a really thick foam. Not stiff peaks or anything, but almost soft peaks. Almost. You dip your finger in it, and a little bump will stay there until you stir it away.

It tastes fine, other than the fact that I added too much ginger and ACV, so it's a little spicy and tart. Which I don't really mind. I wouldn't make it again, but it's kinda interesting.

But why on earth did it foam up so much? My first thought was that maybe the probiotics or whey had baking soda that reacted with the vinegar, but I checked, and neither of them do. This foaminess definitely feels like microbiotic activity, but I use these probiotics all the time and they've never had this effect. Unpasteurized vinegar is probiotic too, but I've never seen it react like this.

All my ingredients were fresh or frozen. The bottle of apple juice was just opened for this specific smoothie. Nothing was expired or even close. The ACV was old AF, but...it's vinegar.

I have the torso(?) of a very deep fried turkey. I supplemented the missing legs and wings with 2lbs of chicken wings.

Ray-Finkle954,,5,"I've been making my way through Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook.... So far so good, until tonight. Most of the meals have been incredible. While they are all a bit time consuming, I wouldn't say anything I've cooked so far is hugely difficult (to be fair, I've really focused on the simpler french bistro staples I love vs. desserts and the more complex dishes). Anyway, was very excited to try the duck confit, was one of few recipes I'd been saving for awhile (personal restaurant fave of mine). Needless to say it was a train wreck. Could now use Reddit's help on trying to figure out where / why it went wrong.

\- Bought 2 duck legs at Whole Foods (I think they were a bit too small, may be part of the issue); they were in a pack that was sealed but still behind the butcher glass; I tried a butcher shop near me first and they only had sealed whole ducks so I decided to pass

\- Made the ""green salt"" and seasoned the legs with it (approx. 1 tbsp per leg); let sit covered in fridge for \~24 hours

\- Dried off the legs and submerged them into the duck fat (french duck fat brand from Amazon, seemed legit) which then went into the oven. I think this may be part of issue because I'm using an older Wolf range oven and the dials are a bit worn down, I put it as close the the 200 degree mark as I could (Keller recommends 190)

\- Let it cook for 10 hours per TK; my place smelled (D)ucking incredible all day btw

\- Let the duck legs cool down, removed from the fat and let them get to room temp

\- While preparing sides generally followed the recipe; I put the duck legs in a non-stick pan (medium) with a little bit of the duck fat and let them go for \~5 minutes. I definitely think I overcooked a bit here, instead of golden brown was more a dark brown (or this was indicative of my prior mistakes). At this point from the outside they still looked generally good though

\- Finished in over for \~6-7 minutes at 350 degrees

So bite in and pretty obvious I overcooked tf out these duck legs, not to mention they were also very salty - overall way too chewy and the color was much darker than they should be. I'm just trying to figure out where / why this went wrong. Was this recipe meant for massive duck legs I should have sourced better? Is 10 hours in a crock pot in the oven way too much (I notice other recipes call for far less time)? Did I have the temp too high (will be buying an oven safe thermometer)? Did I screw it all up in the end with the frying pan / oven re-heat? Any advice or experience would be much appreciated.

I have also seen a video somewhere where a Chef uses Baking Soda to cook Beans faster.

The_New_Doctor,Recipe Troubleshooting,11,"Hello AskCulinary, 

I asked the mods of the sub if this sort of post would be alright, and they said if I included the specific focus of what I was after that it should be fine.

So, over time I've cobbled together relatively fast and cheap recipe for stir fry that I'll make pretty often:

A base (rice or ramen)
To the water cooking it added:
1/2 tsp - Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp - Onion Powder
1/2 tsp - Red Chili Flakes
1 Egg (after cooking)
- If it's rice I mix the egg with an additional 1 tbsp Soy Sauce

Additionally I use some meat (chicken, pork, beef)
I marinate it with:
2 tbsp - Minced Garlic
1 tbsp - Soy Sauce
1 tbsp - Sesame Oil
1/2 tbsp - Worchester Sauce
1 tsp - Sriracha Sauce 
1/2 tsp - White Pepper
1/2 tsp - Cayenne Pepper
1/2 tsp - Red Chili Flakes

Before I cook the meat I sear some vegetables in the pan (which then cook in the marinate with the meat.

Anyways, what I'm looking to adjust is the level of spice in the recipe. I'm not looking to overburden it, but rather just improve it. I've tried a bunch of different variations of where to add which ingredient and when to add it (before cooking the base, or after the entire dish is complete, etc.). So far, the only way I've made it truly unbearable is mixing the Sriracha with the egg that goes into the rice, makes it actually really hard for me to eat.

I was wondering if there were any suggestions of maybe a new spice to add to either the base or marinate, or maybe something to let the vegetables sit in (I don't know if that's really something useful to do like a marinate or put it on while cooking) to more or less introduce a new way for the spices to kick off without it becoming fire while eating it.

I hope this is specific enough to guide, and feel free to let me know if it's not.

Vorshack,Equipment Question,8,"I recently ordered a Zwilling 12.5 inch from Amazon and was shocked the find that the cooking surface curved slightly upwards, resulting in oil pooling around the edges. 

After a bit of research several people had been told by customer service that the curve was intentional, a way of compensating for the way metal reacts to heat. That with the application of heat, cooking surface would become flat.

While this sounds like a very fine theory, my personal experience suggests that it's complete bullshit. I heated the pan on low, medium, and then high (by the time I got to high I was intent on returning it anyways) and there was no visible change in the curvature.

Next I tried ordering some All Clad, the 10 and 12 inch set. Many of *their* representatives claim that the curve is to keep them from spinning on induction stoves. And that they should level out. This time I don't particularity care if it's true, high-end 'chef grade', cookware should be designed with gas ranges in mind. The rest of you heathens can suffer for settling on an inferior stove.

Anyhow, the All Clad had an even steeper curve and went strait back in the box. I'm waiting to ship it back until I get a few responses here.

I'm probably going to try the Vollrath Tribute series next but I would like to know if anyone has actually seen their curved pan (any brand) level out. Or know of one that starts perfectly level and stays that way. At this point I don't care what it costs, I just want a pan that works.

Aetolus13,Equipment Question,1,"Hi everybody
 
I recently rediscovered a piece of cookware that has been sadly neglected for a couple years or so. It‚Äôs an enamel coated cast iron skillet from Lodge. 
 
What is prompting this post is that unlike my enamel coated dutch oven where it clearly has an enamel cooking surface on the inside of the dutch oven, this skillet this black matte finish cooking surface. I was wondering on how to properly clean and maintain it as I have clearly forgotten. I don‚Äôt believe Lodge offers this particular item anymore so I couldn‚Äôt easily find any manufacturers guidance that is geared to this type of finish. 
 
We typically cook with stainless steel and seasoned cast iron cookware (we try to stay away from nonstick coated items as we have birds and are concerned with any potential off gassing that may occur if we over heated the pans. better be safe than sorry). I am pretty familiar on how to use and care for the seasoned cast iron cookware. 
 
Should I be seasoning it like the standard cast iron items or just hand wash and then dry it off like the fully enameled dutch ovens? 
 
Another question I have revolves around enameled cast iron and the application of direct heat. We recently moved to a place which has a gas range. Are there any concerns/steps I need to take when it comes to the direct application of flame to the the enamel surface and maintaining the enamel cookware? 
 
Before this we have always been in places which has an electric range so the enameled cookware was always been exposed to lower heat when compared to direct flames. Seasoned cast iron is perfect for this type of heat and stainless steel doesn‚Äôt have a protective coating that could crack rendering the cookware completely useless.

VivaVariety,,19,"Hey all, I‚Äôm currently staying with my fianc√©e‚Äôs parents for a few weeks. I made the chili recipe I‚Äôve been slowly working on for them, with OK results. Nothing incredible. 

I started off my caramelizing some onions, thin cut green peppers, but then in a slow cooker with some worcestershire and beef bullion. Added some canned sweet corn. Bloomed some thyme, rosemary, basil, and red pepper flakes and put those in with other spices like black pepper, paprika (didn‚Äôt have smoked paprika) cumin, a pinch of habanero pepper and the usual. Added a few table spoons of honey. The obvious kidney and pinto beans. Then what took my chili even further was two table spoons of coffee and a small amount of pure cocoa.

I want something more though. I want something that will really make them go crazy. Chili is my father in laws favorite food. So I will do whatever I need to, to make the best chili I can.

pewpoo,,0,"Like many other home cooks who struggle to get a good hard sear on their meat without setting off their over-sensitive fire alarm in their apartment, Frank Prinsinzano's Brown Butter Method is a must learn. It still gets you a beautiful brown crust, but its done at medium heat rather than high heat, so it never smokes.

To start, melt a lot of butter in a stainless steel pan. Once the water cooks out of the butter and it stops sizzling, add in your meat, some basting herbs, and garlic cloves. Begin basting immedietely. The meat should have a nice steady sizzle the entire time but the butter should never smoke. Keep the heat on medium and if there's any hint its starting to burn, move the pan off the heat for a bit. Flip every few minutes continously basting until it reaches the desired internal temp.

Another benefit of this over the classic ""sear in a smoking hot pan"" is that you can more generously season the meat without worrying about pepper or garlic powder burning. You get a glorious fond and plenty of leftover brown butter to cook any veggies in while the meat rests.

pinhead1900,,28,"Hi,

I've been making a mexican style chicken soup in a slow cooker for years. I aways get good reviews on it but personally I know it can be more flavorful and a bit richer.
Typically I start with placing 1.5lb-2lb boneless and skinless chicken breast in the slow cooker and cover it with a can of rotel chopped tomatoes and chillies (I've tried fresh tomatoes and chilies and canned has been better). I let the chicken cook on high for about 4 hours unitl I can pull it apart.
I then shred the chicken breasts and mix in with the juices. At this point I add about 2 qt of chicken broth. And all my veggies + cumin + chilli powder + S&amp;P.
I let all the ingredients cook on low for about 3-4 more hours and serve.

A few questions. I'm considering switching to chicken thighs this next go around. The thighs I have in the fridge are bone-in with skin. Should I debone and trim the skin? Or should I cook with skin on and pull the bones when I shred the chicken. 
Second I'm considering searing the chicken in a cast iron pan before I put it in the slow cooker, thinking it may add some additional flavor.

PJLondon,Technique Question,14,"For almost a year I've enjoyed using my Marcato pasta machine and slowly perfecting my spaghetti over time using 00 flour. However, I'm still having trouble with my spaghetti strands sticking together as they come through the machine at the final stage.

During the process I use appropriate amounts of flour and get the dough to a great, firm consistency which flattens through the roller nicely with occasional dusting. But when it comes to the spaghetti attachment, each batch comes through the crank without problem, except several strands which stick together, resulting in thick clumps when boiled. 

The only solution I can think of is to lay each batch flat once it comes out of the spaghetti attachment and ensure that every strand is separately cut. But this will a) take so much longer, b) negate the point of the spaghetti attachment, and c) probably result in twice as many strands sticking together, before being transferred over to the hanger.

I'm convinced there must be something I can do at the spaghetti attachment stage to ensure that all strands come out the other side completely separated.

I cant get the real Parmigiano Reggiano where i live so dont know how it really tastes to adjust (if possible) the stuff i can get (which is still frm Italy and frm a very decent deli)

The best 'parmesan' i can get comes in a wheel with rind.  After grating it, i cant really detect much salt.  It even smells/tastes a bit like unsalted butter but maybe a tiny bit saltier.   Ive tried anothr brand and it tastes almost the same bland too. Not cheddar cheese salty at all. 

How far is that from the real stuff?  

Ive read that real stuff is nutty and fruity... But how about the salt level?   I was expecting it to be saltier i.e. More similar to 'parmesan' that comes in a big green shaker is supermarkets?  That one tastes (at least to me) much closer to cheddar but with a different twist.  

Anyway if it should taste saltier... Then should i thus adjust recipes by adding salt?

They appear to be firmly stuck at the pit, even though the top half is so mushy it gave when I tried to twist it. What gives? Is it uneven ripening? I chopped it up and the bottom portion was still hard.

If it helps, they were hass avocados. Pretty bummed out because I was trying to make guacamole and half the ingredients have already rotted just waiting for the avocados to ripen :("

Hi all and thanks in advance. I‚Äôm trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn‚Äôt come across for 60+ years.

For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.

She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.

I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker. It also wasn‚Äôt sweet at all and she said the texture of the cocoa butter was creamy whereas the mystery item was crunchy.

I‚Äôm making an apple spice cake with buttercream frosting, and I was considering browning the butter for both the batter and the frosting mixtures. The recipe though doesn‚Äôt call for this. 

I figure that during the browning process some of the water is evaporated out, does that mean I would need to add some water into both the buttercream and batter mixture to compensate, or would this not be necessary? If I do need to make changes, what would you all recommend?

Brotilla,Ingredient Question,5,"Hello r/AskCulinary, have loved this community and the questions that have come through here.  I am SUPER excited to finally have something to ask!!

So, I am a fan of H mart, a N. American korean supermarket chain.  They're a great asian supermarket with good produce and all your favorite hard to find culinary ingredients (as an American born chinese kid trying to reconnect with his culinary heritage, they almost always have what I need).  I like shopping and buying their off cuts when I see them.  Sometimes it's leftover cut offs from a filleted salmon, sometimes it's a salmon head (i'm learning that salmon head soup is AMAZING and I need to try that recipe one of these days; hit me up if you've got a favorite). 

So what did I find on my most recent trip? I found ""short rib skin"" packaged in a styrofoam under plastic; as I suspected, it was the gristly, silverskin that had been cut off of the short ribs when they were butchering them.  I decided to give it a shot because short ribs are amazing and I figured I could figure something out.  

I ended up cutting them into small strips, seasoning with soy sauce, sesame oil, salt &amp; pepper and stir-frying them with together with some wilted and similarly sliced taiwanese cabbage.  It was...better than expected.  Flavor was great, and the texture was a litle gristly, but otherwise tasted great over rice.  There was sort of a similar snap that you'd get from a braised pig ear or jellyfish that you sometime see at chinese banquets.  All things considered, not a bad experiment; would probably do it again.  

My question for r/AskCulinary is: someone at this store went to the trouble of stacking up pieces of short rib silver skin and sold them for 5.99/lb.  I certainly haven't ever cooked with it before.

recently I've bought a deep fryer in order to step up my frying game. 

Today I have made homemade fries and even though I done everything I should according to the recipes, the fries were missing most of the crunch. The inside was fluffy like it should be and the taste was great, but the crunch was missing.

My approach:

1) I had the correct starchy potatoes.
2) I cut them to the same size.
3) I let them sit in a water for a bit to let the starch come to the surface.
4) I dried them before frying.
5) First frying - 160 C / 325 F - six minutes
6) Second frying - 190 C / 370 F - six minutes
7) Used vegetable oil specifically for deep frying.

I have two theories what could have went wrong:

a) I put all of them in the frying basket, I should have made them in smaller batches

b) I put the lid on when frying so the accumulated moisture probably made them soggier?

Any advice would be appreciated! I need to master it to make the most perfect fries when I already have the tools.",AskCulinary,Why are my deep fried french fries soggy?,1602196408,8,185,"Why are my deep fried french fries soggy? Hello,

Silent_Gamerz,Food Science Question,17,"Hi r/AskCulinary!

I recently bought a 4lb bag of frozen tilapia and realized after it was sourced from China.  So, I did some digging on SeaFood watch and found their recommendations (sources at bottom of post), which basically concluded:  Any country, except China, will be at least ""okay"", but that the certification for most Chinese Tilapia (which represents &gt;80% of the Tilapia that gets imported to the U.S. from all countries, btw) is marked ""okay"" (just barely, see ""benchmark"" reference below) by the Global Aquaculture Alliance.  


When I read through the 50+ pages of studies and more, I found nothing addressing the chemicals that were already in the water being an influence.  And to be fair, none of the other country sources/certs touched on it either - Seafood Watch seems to have dropped the ball on this, by instead addressing the chemicals output into the environment, while ignoring the input chemical factors (i.e. I'd like to know how safe I am eating the fish, not just how much it pollutes the water for wild fish - an important distinction).  


Scouring the web has left me at a loss, **which brings me to my questions:**  **Does anyone know of any resources covering water safety influence on fish?**  Notably, I am curious about Tilapia, but in general I'd love to know this answer!  This doesn't seem to be a straight-forward question, for two reasons:  
A.  Typically the chemicals we fear (i.e. mercury) are stored in bones (you won't eat that in tilapia) or fat (very little of that in tilapia, especially since it's culled young \[which also means less years of mercury accumulation\]).  So, mercury isn't a big concern (and I've read similar about most antibiotics, too), but **are there other chemicals of concern that live in the meat (protein) of the fish?**  If not, then the chemical levels of the water, from a human consumption health perspective, should be negligible.  
B.  The studies comparing water I have found are for seawater, but tilapia is a freshwater fish (i.e. grown in ponds).  


**Please Note:**  I've seen other redditors raise similar questions in past, but people often respond with unrelated stuff, so I'd please ask you try to keep responses on topic.  For instance, personal taste / cooking preference is cool, but there's other posts devoted to that already.  Discussions on omega six-to-3 ratio being very high is off-topic (and also kinda dumb imho, since the fish is culled young to have so little fat it should barely influence in an otherwise balanced diet).  Discussions about how it's more unhealthy than bacon (unfounded) and is a not real fish (i.e. you don't think tilapia exists in the wild?  Lol, okay).

I have been making homemade Alfredo sauce for years, and most of the time it turns out amazing. However sometimes the sauce separates, the cheese get clumped up and I would like to know why.

Important factors:

\- I make an Americanized Alfredo sauce with heavy cream. I am well aware of the traditional method of just butter &amp; pasta water to make the sauce, however I really do like the cream and do not want to get rid of it completely.

\- I have never used flour and do not want to.

\- I use pre-shredded Parmesan cheese. I am aware of the anti-caking agent on pre-shredded cheese. I also know it is better and easier to get a good consistency with a real wedge of cheese.

\- I never measure. I ""eyeball"" all of the ingredients.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite these seeming drawbacks, I have made perfect Alfredo sauce countless times. I would say that about 85% of the time, it comes out perfect even if I let it get too hot. There have even been times that I cook it slow and low and it still doesn't turn out. I would really like to track down what exactly the problem is for consistency's sake.

I believe it is one or both of these possibilities:

\- Either too much, or not enough fat (butter/cream).

I usually use around 2 tblsp butter and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream to 6-7oz cheese.

\- The temperature I cook it at. 

At times I have had the cheese sauce literally boiling and it still turns out. I know it is not supposed to go above a simmer, but like I said it HAS turned out perfectly even if I let it boil.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I would like to lower the amount of heavy cream that I use. I currently use 1 1/2 cups, which is a staggering 1200+ calories. I still want to use heavy cream, but to a lesser extent, so I am looking for a viable alternative. I would like to lower the heavy cream to around 1/2 cup, and hopefully I can use pasta water to add volume to the sauce? Basically I am wondering if you can combine butter, heavy cream, and pasta water successfully.

DevonWeeks,Ingredient Question,8,"I've made burgers for years.  Decades.  I'm pretty proficient at it.  I seen some shit, to use a phrase that seems popular with the young people these days.  But this morning I had the strangest experience.

If I make a burger that's thicker than a smashburger, I temp the burger and pull it at 155F.  If it's a really, really thick burger like a half pound patty, then I may pull it at 160.  Regardless, it's cooked through after I let it rest.  

But today?  Today I temped a roughly 1/3 pound patty in the pan.  It read 157F in the thickest part of the patty.  Perfect, right?  Well, I don't know.  When I pulled the patty and let it rest, I toasted my bun and put on my toppings.  Then after about 5 minutes or so, I put my patty on my burger and sat down to eat. 

Imagine my surprise when I bit into this burger and it was a very dark shade of pink inside.  Like, if it were a steak, you'd have insisted it was medium rare judging by color.  It was that dark pink.  For the life of me I couldn't figure it out.  The Thermopen said it was almost 160 when I pulled it off the pan.  So, I took it back to the kitchen and temped it again where the dark pink meat was.  And now it said 156F.  

I **know** this meat is cooked.  It's is hot to the touch and the probe clearly indicates it has been brought up to temp.  So, why it my ground beef still dark pink inside?  I went ahead an ate the burger.  It seemed to taste fine, but it was a bit anxiety-inducing not being sure why my burger patty didn't change color inside after being cooked.  

Here I am almost 12 hours later and not feeling sick at all, so that's a win.  And it did taste good.

BloatedBaryonyx,,8,"I wouldn't consider myself much of a cook, but I do enjoy cooking. I'm definitely what you'd consider a beginner . I have access to a limited range of appliances and tools, and am limited by budget on what I can cook.

I want to start making new recipes and trying new things, but my boyfriend doesn't want to try anything I make so I end up making two different dishes every time- which is just a massive pain. The only food I've gotten him to eat is a homemade burger, which I'm proud to say he prefers to the shop bought stuff.

I want him to try new things so we can enjoy new foods together (and so we don't have twice as much washing up to do). The problem is he won't eat most things. Here's a list of things he's hard no on:

1) Soups, stews, or anything resembling them. This apparently includes casseroles.

2) Pasta. He apparently has exactly one pasta that he likes (specific brand, specific shape) that we can't find. He will not eat pasta or noodles.

3) Fish. He'll eat pollock or cod sometimes and enjoys it, but we ate so much fish in our first year together (my fault, I love the stuff, I'd eat it for every meal if I could) that he's totally gone off of it.

4) Rice. Plain rice is fine with store-bought tikka masala sauce, but not on its own.

5) Most meats. He can't stand beef, pork, lamb, etc... but will have ground beef if it's in something else. He's fine with chicken and turkey, but not in ground form.

6) Most vegetables. He likes peas and potatoes and reluctantly eats carrots.

7) Any gravy/sauce that isn't chicken gravy.

It's so frustrating! We have an incredibly limited budget so we can't spend much money experimenting  and so most of the time it's not worth buying anything if only I'm going to eat it- I don't want food to just sit in the fridge and go bad when we could have spent that money on something else. The man eats chicken breast, chicken nuggets, pizza, fish fingers, faggots, a specific brand of tinned meatballs and damn near nothing else.

By far the biggest problem is that with such a narrow range of foods to choose from, he actually goes off some of them if he eats them too often. This is how he went off of fish, fried rice and omelettes. He never goes back onto them, and I'm worried that one day there will be nothing he can bring himself to eat.

It's driving me mad! His food is easy to cook but I just want him to eat sausage casserole with me, or have the nice pasta I've made. He says that he's tried most stuff before and hated it, and will gag/vomit when he tries any of it. To be fair, this isn't totally an exaggeration- it does make him feel ill and occasionally gag (he has no allergies, to be clear). 

Does anybody have any suggestions? I'm looking for recipes that work around his pickiness or ideas to make anything on this list more appealing to him.

1) you have to cut them up as conservatively as possible to prevent aromatic (culinarily, not chemically) compounds from breaking down

2) leeks often have dirt in between layers, so I have to halve and clean them up. Problem is, if I do that after thawing they will be mushy and hard to work with.

*Roasted pumpkin and carrot layer cake with cardamom-infused marscapone filling and pomegranate caramel sauce.*

I have a couple of pie pumpkins lying around, and a ton of carrots that need to be used up. My plan is to roast them on the grill and then turn into puree.

Inspired_,,15,"Hello!

So I originally wrote an extremely long post with the entire backstory of my life but that ended up at 2700 words (maybe I should try some therapy instead lol). I've tried now to shorten it alot, but I dont think I succeeded. So feel free to skip this post if you cannot be assed.

*Short backstory*

28y old male that after 8 years in a very toxic situation, my boss being a real psychopath (legit, he is today being investigated by the police for being reported by 3 people including me for emotional and physical abuse)  I moved across my entire country with my wife and started a new job.

But then I quit my ""new"" job right in february of this year cause the business I have been in for 8 years now gave me the heebie jeebies. 

Then Covid hit and it was impossible to get a new job. So I loafed around at home for 3-4 months, naturally cooking a whole bunch at home since that has been my biggest interest since I was like 15. 

*The Scenario:*

My entire life I've had a stupid belief (""If I start working as a cook I will probably lose all my passion and fun for cooking"") which I've now discovered is complete bullshit.

But I grew tired of that belief and finally said fuck it, I contacted the people who deal with cooking internships here and I got very lucky and got a long term internship at the best restaurant in my area.  
Reservations only, tasting menu, high end. Its also a very unique location and because of that the kitchen is a very small open solution and only has room for 3 ppl. This makes it so that the head chef mainly develops the menu, checks plate and otherwise entertains guests, while the rest of us (experienced cook and 2 interns) do EVERYTHING else. Doing everything is great for a new cook learning, instead of being a dishwasher for 6 months.

After a few weeks the issues start.   
I am in my own opinion an above average home cook as its been such a huge interest for me, by using books, videos and practice ive taught myself everything from professional knife skills, to baking to the science of food. 

But a high pace high end restaurant with very high standards makes me a bit nervous. 

So I obviously went into it with a very motivated but humble and careful mindset, being afraid of making too many mistakes and squandering my chance of staying there after new years (im trialing with pay untill january)

So for the first month I did things slowly and accurately. I doublechecked everything and did things way too meticulously and therefore was also much slower than necessary doing my tasks. 

And I properly noticed this a few weeks ago and I started the process of trying to better myself.

Trust myself alot more, do stuff that I know needs to be done, dont ask questions I know the answer to, speed everything up, ETC.

But I'm afraid it might be too late if I don't do something drastic.  
I feel that due to my first impression my two colleagues have a view of me that is not good for me at all. I think they feel I'm slow, dont know how to do stuff, need constant mentoring and cant be trusted with important things. Under is an example of this.

*The random example:*

So they end up viewing everything I do like that and after receiving a task its happened several times that the experienced cook has taken the task away from me in the middle of it because she thinks Im being too slow. 

Then I watch her finish the task and we were working at the same pace.   
But I was doing the stuff that you dont notice progress from right away (like peeling the onions first) or I had other tasks to do at the same time (emptying out the ice-cream maker or something) so I appear slower, and due to my first impression she thinks im being slow and takes it away from me.

*Conclusion and question:*

This was one hell of a ramble but I hope I get my point across.

I am worried that I will not keep my dream job if I dont do something drastic.

I have no clue how a normal kitchen operates, how the personalities usually are and how I should act in this situation.

nosy_hobbit,,18,"So, I know oil is used as a means to transfer heat into the protein. But how does one decide how much oil to use? Specifically, does more oil mean less fond stuck to the bottom of the pan but better, more consistent heat transfer into the full surface of the protein for ""fuller"" cooking and a greater surface area of browning? Is that a trade-off? If you finish your dish in the oven, does that affect how much oil is to be used?

Assume large stainless steel cookware is being used - large enough to easily fit at least 2 pieces of protein. Although if cast-iron (or non-stick carbon steel) is to be used differently, I'd love to learn more about that too.

Across all the cooking videos I've watched, I've seen:

Chicken: anywhere from a small amount of oil (a few tablespoons, lots of little dry spots in the pan) to a large amount of oil (like a small puddle, 1/8-1/4 an inch deep, enough to come up the bottom \~1 cm of the meat). From my personal experience, I've gotten more fond stuck to the bottom of the pan when using less oil. When I use more oil, I pour it off before deglazing, and a lot of the brown bits in the oil are poured off with it. I feel like I'm losing flavor when that happens.

Pork chops: a large amount of oil. Again, enough to come up the bottom \~1 cm of the meat. I may have seen a few videos with less oil, but can't remember.

Steak: like chicken, anywhere from little to no oil or a lot of oil. Some even dribble the oil on the steak itself before putting into the pan.

morkus64,,8,"So I started making bread a couple of months ago and now I'm definitely spoiled. Instead of getting grocery store bread, I'm hoping to start making a 2kg dough on the weekend, split into 3 or 4, refrigerate, and bake every other day throughout the week.

CookingForMoney,Recipe Troubleshooting,1,"Hi,

I would like to make an Italian meringue that lasts long enough to use for service ideally for five consecutive days. I've made some progress and this is what I've learned so far.

* Use room temperature eggs.
* Use eggs that are as fresh as possible. Old eggs whip up more easily but form a less stable meringue.
* Use a tiny bit of tartaric acid or lemon juice on the bowl or while mixing the eggs.
* Use real eggs, not egg whites in a jug. Eggs in a jug have highly variable properties.
* Start beating the whites slowly and then gradually increase the speed to medium until soft peaks form. The slow speed in the beginning supposedly help to make air bubbles that are smaller and more stable, as far as I understand it.
* Add the syrup in a slow drizzle when the whites are at the soft peak stage.
* Don't overbeat the meringue.
* Absolutely no grease, whether in the bowl or on any tools. Any slightest bit of yolk in the whites you have to start over.

The parametric recipe I use is as follows:
* 100% egg whites
* 200% sugar
* 1% tartaric acid (I used 2% in my previous attempt but found that it affects the flavor quite a bit)
* Salt (optional, for flavor. Unsure if it has any effect on structure)
* 120C/248F

After the meringue has cooled down I put it all in piping bags and only open them as I need them for service.

&amp;nbsp;

The following are the signs of degradation:
* Texture will become noticeably less smooth and ""grainy"". In a bad meringue this gradual degradation is noticeable over the course of a single evening.
* After a few days in the fridge the meringue may leak sugary syrup at which point it has to be discarded.
* After a few days, if the meringue is otherwise stable, chewy sugary flakes will form inside the meringue. At this point it will also have to be discarded.

&amp;nbsp;

I have some ideas which might help make the meringue stay stable for longer:
* Never go faster than medium high while whipping.
* After all the syrup is added and the meringue has reached max volume/stiff peaks and it has to keep spinning for a few minutes to cool down, I will try and lower the speed to medium so as to not overbeat.
* Some sources have suggested freezing the meringue, I'm currently experimenting with this. I would freeze filled piping bags and defrost in the fridge over a few hours.
* I have access to various food stabilizers but I don't know of any that would make a difference? My only idea right now is to add egg white powder to the egg whites before beating.
* I've seen other recipes which use more sugar and cook to a lower temperature (115C/239F) which might behave differently and might be worth trying. However the formation of sugary flakes suggest to me that sugar wants to come out of the foam so adding more sugar might accelerate that process.
* Ambient humidity will have a detrimental effect but in a commercial kitchen this is mostly out of my control. Perhaps make the meringue early in the morning before we have a lot of stock pots boiling, dishwashers running, etc? Just throwing things at the wall here.

&amp;nbsp;

I currently have a meringue that has retained reasonably good texture but has developed sugary, chewy flakes on day 5. I've not been able to find any information on why this problem occurs. I'm wondering if it could have something to do with specks of sugar syrup that don't get incorporated into the meringue while drizzling and end up on the side of the bowl? 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for any suggestions on how I can change the recipe or procedure to make a meringue with better texture and that retains its structure for longer. If you work a lot with Italian meringue, do you have any tips of storage and how long do you expect your meringue to stay viable?
